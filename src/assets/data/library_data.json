Why did the community do this? To see if it could be done, it seems.</p>\n<p>The Half-Life 2 'Breaking the Bar' event was organised by fan community <a href=\"https://community.lambdageneration.com/\">Lambda Generation</a>, which wanted to see if the fans could push Half-Life 2's concurrent player count peak up from the low 6,882 it appeared on <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/app/220/graphs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SteamDB</a>. It seems they succeeded in even beating the all-time peak of 12,953 players from 10 years ago. The new record stands at a much more respectable 16,101.</p>\n<p>The problem with Half-Life 2's records is that the game pre-dates most of Steam's tracking features, as it was the title that Steam launched with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/epic-store-time-played\">in the most bare-boned state imaginable</a>. By the time Steam had begun tracking things like concurrent player counts, most people had already finished Half-Life 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-2/player-count\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-2/remastered-collection-mod\">Half-Life 2: Remastered Collection coming from modders with Valve's consent</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-2/mod-backwards-speedrun\">Half-Life 2 speedrunners beat the game backwards in 13 minutes</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-2/gabe-newell-sends-gnome-chompski-to-space\">Gabe Newell is sending a garden gnome into outer space</a></p>",

I didn't come round in the bathroom having the idea for the Flux Capacitor, but I did bonk my noggin pretty hard in the office games room and sit back, dazed but delighted with what had just happened.</p><p>I was playing the Budget Cuts demo on Valve's room-scale VR. Budget Cuts is a game about infiltrating an office that's patrolled with deadly robots. Because of the room-scale VR, you're really there: your actual body is your in-game body. This means that the robots are the same size as you - which is terrifying - and it also means that when you have to duck your head through a missing panel in the floor to look into the room below, you really have to do it. Except that while the game floor might be missing a panel, the real floor isn't. Bonk. I did it. Chris Bratt, who had also played the demo, had done it. A day later, so moved by what I'd played I brought in a friend to try it out. They did it too. We all hit our heads and we all saw the future.</p><p>More than just the future of video games, I really felt like I had seen the future of one series in particular. I still think this. I still think that Budget Cuts is essentially the closest I've ever gotten to playing Half-Life 3. It's not set in the Half-Life universe, although its mixture of horrific technology and the banal and bureaucratic is not a million miles away. It wasn't made by a Valve team, although I gather the people who made it did end up working on the final game at Valve as incubees. Instead, it channels that magical thing that Half-Life has always done.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-19-a-new-half-life-would-have-to-be-vr\">Read more</a></p>",

It&rsquo;s the freestyle skating to proper CS&rsquo;s baseball, using a movement glitch to skid, glide, and soar through maps filled with abstract shapes. It is stylish as all hell. And people race surfing! Or you could go freestyle and hit cool tricks to wow judges! Maybe you could even do synchronised routines! Or, like with the X-Games, you could think it seems too much effort and just watch YouTube videos and coo approvingly. So let&rsquo;s do that, for now.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/09/counter-strike-surfing-is-the-esport-we-deserve/#more-910241\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Counter-Strike surfing is the esport we deserve\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n",

There, a Dutch teenager who goes by &ldquo;RD&rdquo; (&ldquo;RealDespair&rdquo;) has long claimed to have been the original author of fy_iceworld. His now defunct portfolio site went on a lengthy rant about it:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yes, you read it right. I am the creator of this unholy monster. When i created this map i had absolutely no idea how popular it would become. It is sad that there are many txt files in rotation from kids that claim to have made this map, but you have now stumbled upon the true author&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Was RD actually responsible for making one of <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/22/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map/\">the most influential and popular game maps of all time</a>? I began a forensic investigation to verify its authorship, digging through the ancient detritus of dead Geocities pages, Angelfire websites, and Romanian file servers. I even datamined the fy_iceworld file for clues. I now know what &ldquo;fy_&rdquo; actually meant, and it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fight yard.&rdquo; Originally, it wasn&rsquo;t even called fy_iceworld either! But let&rsquo;s start from the beginning.</p><p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/23/who-made-fy_iceworld-a-forensic-investigation/#more-821835\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Who made fy_iceworld?

I was, of course, one of the haters. I tried to convince my friends to vote against fy_iceworld on our local internet cafe&rsquo;s CS server, but they argued that I was just salty about being bad at it (which was partly true) and they forced the mapchange anyway. Similar conversations played out across countless clan servers, cyber cafes, PC bangs, and LAN parties around the entire world. </p><p>To properly gauge fy_iceworld&rsquo;s influence and legacy, I asked several working level designers for their takes.

This will allow players to adjust voice chat volume of every individual player in a server. This feature will need to be implemented manually by gamemode and server developers and is already available in the default Sandbox scoreboard, by using the mouse scroll wheel on the mute button.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/rubat/1b0811b1/voice_scale.gif[/img]\n\nAs per usual, you can find the full change list for this update below.\n\nYou will find the full change list for this update in our blog post:\n[url=https://gmod.facepunch.com/blog/june-2021-update]https://gmod.facepunch.com/blog/june-2021-update[/url]\n\n[quote]This update requires servers to update before you can join them.\n\nThis means that for a certain amount of time after the update releases you may be unable to join servers and get a message saying \"The server is running an older version of the game\"  instead. You will have to wait for servers to update before you can join them again.\n\nYou cannot downgrade to a previous version of the game.

Now noodlespagoodle has done something similar in Unreal Engine 5 (thanks <a href=\"https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/bioshock-fan-remaster-unreal-engine-5-amazing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DSOGaming</a>).</p>\n<p>The short demo uses the original textures from BioShock to keep faithful to the game, but the developer has created an original scenario in a new part of Rapture. It looks, feels, and plays like a better-looking remake of BioShock, complete with a lot of identifiable features such as the Gatherer's Garden vending machine, weapons, audio logs, UI, a crazed Splicer, a Little Sister, and even a Big Daddy in an underwater fight - but there are some obvious differences too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/bioshock/unreal-engine-5\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/bioshock/humble-heal-covid-19-bundle\">Humble crams $657 worth of stuff into a $20 bundle, and every penny goes to COVID relief</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/bioshock/bioshock-ken-levine-apology\">BioShock's director has apologised for that naked final boss fight</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/worst-boss-fights\">9 of the worst boss fights we've ever endured</a></p>",

I will always remember the moment in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic when I found out who my character really was, and always remember the moment in BioShock when I found out who the real baddie was. These things make a game, they sear it into our memories. </p><p>But once you know the secret what then? The game is done more or less. You might get a bit of mileage from playing again and spotting the clues, but there are no real surprises left to be had, not unless you're Nier Automata but let's not go there now. \nBut what if a story could change? What if it was fundamentally different a second time around? </p><p>I got to thinking about this recently after talking to a man called Ray Winninger, the head of Dungeons & Dragons, tabletop side. He's only recently been appointed that position after spending many years away from Wizards of the Coast, but he's been involved with and playing D&D most of his life. He professionally wrote campaigns as a teenager and even played with the game's creators, Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax. Dungeons & Dragons is in his bones.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-07-22-what-if-we-could-shuffle-plot-twists-each-time-we-played\">Read more</a></p>",

                                "contents": "<p>You can fit San Andreas into Grand Theft Auto 5 several times over, yet the former still feels bigger. That&#x2019;s the most surprising takeaway from my time revisiting Rockstar&#x2019;s &#x2019;90s crime epic, which has sold a staggering 21 million copies in its lifetime. Released on PC in 2005, a year after the PlayStation 2 version, it&#x2019;s a massive step up from the previous game, Vice City, in pretty much every respect.&#xA0;</p><p>In the early-to-mid 2000s you couldn&#x2019;t move for GTA clones: True Crime, The Getaway, Scarface: The World is Yours, Saints Row. But while these games were largely, or entirely, set in a single city, Rockstar used its unmatched financial might (and, some might say, hubris) to take things to the next level, presenting an entire state to cause mayhem in. California analogue San Andreas contains acres of country, a desert, and three cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas.&#xA0;</p><p>The first 15 hours of San Andreas take place in Los Santos, Rockstar&#x2019;s satirical recreation of 1990s Los Angeles. This is not LA as it really was, but an exaggerated version of the city viewed through the lens of movies such as Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society, and through the music of Snoop Dogg and NWA. It&#x2019;s all lowriders, orange sunsets, police helicopters scanning the streets with searchlights, and gangbangers swigging forties on the corner.&#xA0;</p><p>Protagonist Carl &apos;CJ&apos; Johnson, an ex-gangster, returns home to Los Santos from Liberty City to bury his mother, but soon finds himself tangled up in the life of petty gang violence he tried to leave behind.&#xA0;</p><p>To prevent you from immediately just leaving Los Santos and heading out to explore the rest of the state, corrupt cop Frank Tenpenny (played brilliantly by Samuel L Jackson) warns CJ that if he tries to skip town, the full weight of the law will come crashing down on him.&#xA0;</p><p>Of course, you&#x2019;re still going to try. The first time I played San Andreas I made a beeline straight for San Fierro, the game&#x2019;s version of San Francisco. But the moment you leave the boundaries of Los Santos you get a maximum wanted level, surviving which is pretty much impossible. Today, open worlds rarely keep you contained in one part of the map&#x2014;and certainly not for as long as San Andreas does. But for a game this size I think it&#x2019;s a good idea.</p><p><br></p>\n<h3>Country life</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you finally finish the first act, you almost feel like you&#x2019;ve been in Los Santos for the length of an entire GTA game. Which makes the moment when CJ is dumped in the countryside by Tenpenny even more exciting. Gone are the traffic-clogged streets and the endless sea of buildings. You&#x2019;re surrounded by trees, mountains, and rivers. Even the cars and pedestrians change to reflect your new surroundings, with the lowriders and gangsters replaced by hillbillies and trucks.&#xA0;</p><p>Rockstar pulls the same trick here, containing you in the countryside as you complete a series of missions for crazed bank robber Catalina and paranoid hippy The Truth. What I love about this section of the game is how, occasionally, you catch tantalising glimpses of San Fierro in the distance&#x2014;most notably the Gant Bridge (Rockstar&#x2019;s take on the Golden Gate Bridge) and the Big Pointy Building, a parody of the Transamerica Pyramid. The game seems impossibly big at times.</p>\n<h3>Short order</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Playing San Andreas today, there&#x2019;s a sense Rockstar bit off more than it could chew. The game&#x2019;s draw distance is incredibly short, with a huge amount of pop-in, which was presumably the only way they could get the thing running on the hardware of the time.&#xA0;</p><p>There&#x2019;s also a noticeable drop in fidelity once you leave Los Santos, with San Fierro, and especially Las Venturas, feeling a little sparse and lifeless compared to the smaller cities from the previous 3D-era games.&#xA0;</p><p>But it feels massive, which I think is a combination of that draw distance obscuring the view ahead, and also the sheer amount of relatively empty space on the map. The countryside and desert in San Andreas seem genuinely barren and remote, while the rural areas in Grand Theft Auto 5 never feel totally isolated from the busier parts of the map. When you&#x2019;re riding through the desert west of Las Venturas, or the rugged rural expanse of Red County, you feel totally disconnected from civilisation, which adds to its sense of scale.&#xA0;</p><p>San Andreas is a highly moddable game, and it&#x2019;s possible to massively expand the draw distance in the PC version. But this removes that illusion of size, especially when you can see all three cities from one high vantage point. If you want to explore the map with a little more visual fidelity, a mod that transplants the entirety of San Andreas into GTA IV is available, although the clash of modern lighting and old school geometry is a little jarring to look at.&#xA0;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When CJ eventually reaches San Fierro, the look, feel, and tone of the game changes dramatically. The warm haze of Los Santos is replaced by a cold, blue-tinged colour palette, rain, and fog, and CJ gets involved with the Triads, street racing, and buying property. This variety is one of San Andreas&#x2019; strong points, although the story does lose some steam here. Rockstar is generally very good at telling long, compelling stories that take place across vast maps, but in San Andreas there are several points where the narrative sags and interest wanes.</p><p>But by the time CJ hits the Las Venturas strip, things gear up to the point where San Andreas feels more like a James Bond game. From that first bicycle ride through downtown Los Santos to jumping out of planes and robbing casinos, the classic GTA rags-to-riches story is at its most heightened and absurd here. When GTA 4 opted for a more subdued, grounded story, fans often cried out for a return to the over-the-top action of San Andreas&#x2014;a request fulfilled by its excellent Ballad of Gay Tony DLC, which restored some of that frivolity.</p><p>The story comes full circle as CJ returns to Los Santos to settle the score with his treacherous former allies, now packing a massive arsenal of weapons and huge amounts of cash. It&#x2019;s fun to see CJ grow from the broke, skinny kid in a tank-top to the tattooed, muscular, jewellery-laden crime boss he ultimately becomes.</p><p>Of course, his appearance is completely up to you. I know someone who finished San Andreas and never changed his clothes, hair, or body at all, apart from when a mission required it. While I must have spent at least ten hours of my total playtime getting my CJ looking as cool as possible.</p>\n<h3>Mission control</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>San Andreas is difficult to play nowadays. The world is still fun to explore, but the missions themselves haven&#x2019;t aged well at all. The shooting is clunky, the driving feels twitchy and weightless, and it&#x2019;s punishingly difficult&#x2014;especially in the final act. And the less said about those tedious RC missions given by San Fierro nerd Zero (voiced by David &#x2018;Tobias F&#xFC;nke&#x2019; Cross) the better. Honestly, if you feel the need to return to the state of San Andreas, just download a completed save file and enjoy exploring the world without any hassle.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think even Rockstar could make anything with this level of scope today. With the fidelity expected of a modern game, an open world with three distinct cities would be a tall order. Its most recent, Red Dead Redemption 2, is its biggest yet, but benefits from being set in a time when much of the United States was countryside. This makes San Andreas something of a one off. A snapshot of Rockstar at its most brash, bold, and ambitious, showing the pretenders that they were still the king of the open-world crime epic.&#xA0;</p><p>Vice City is arguably a better, tighter game, but this was a fine final chapter for GTA&#x2019;s all-conquering PlayStation era. It was also one of the first worlds that was so big it generated its own mythology, inside and outside of the game. Whether it was bigfoot, UFOs, ghost cars, or chainsaw killers, an entire community emerged dedicated to documenting and discovering the weird stuff Rockstar hid in its world. I myself saw a UFO in San Andreas. It was hovering over a bridge in the countryside. Then it zipped off when I approached. It could&#x2019;ve been a glitch, but I want to believe.</p>",

The process, which only works in the Windows Store version of the game, lets the player warp to a later mission after performing a series of complex steps, and is based on a similar technique used in GTA: Vice City speedruns. The actual moment of the skip happens around the 16 minute mark in the video.</p><p>Powdinet detailed the full technique in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/ddrsfd/grand_theft_auto_san_andreas_skip_that_saves_over/\" target=\"_blank\">this Reddit post</a>: it has more than 40 steps, the first being to start the game and find a police bike. In the final step, starting an in-vehicle vigilante mission during a specific part of the mission Ryder makes the game jump forward, with the landing point linked to the amount of time since the run started. &quot;With the ability to execute any line of script code, we can warp to any mission we want,&quot; Powdinet explains.</p><p>They&apos;ve been searching for this type of glitch for three years on and off in San Andreas and found a version of the warp &quot;months ago&quot;, but couldn&apos;t get it to stick. Now, they&apos;ve finally managed to make it work, and they expect other speedrunners to shave even more time off the record by using the glitch.</p><p>Powdinet completed the game in 25m 52s&#x2014;the previous record, set by Ielreset, was 3h 52m 07s, according to <a href=\"https://www.speedrun.com/gtasa\" target=\"_blank\">speedrun.com</a>.</p><p>Thanks, <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/new-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-speedrunning-trick-sh-1838953554\" target=\"_blank\">Kotaku</a>.</p>",

But, it turns out McAvoy's not only turned his talents to acting in games - he's also a long-time fan of playing them, too. So much so that he once melted a copy of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion because he just enjoyed it so darn much.</p>\n<p>That's according to an interview with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2021/08/13/why-james-mcavoy-burned-his-favorite-game-and-quit-playing-for-a-decade/\">Forbes</a> in which the actor, known for his roles in Atonement, the X-Men movies, and the His Dark Materials series, chats about Twelve Minutes. McAvoy recalls a time back in 2007 when he was filming Jane Austen biopic Becoming Jane and was super into Bethesda's <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc\">RPG game</a> Oblivion, which launched the year before. \"That was a kind of game I'd always been into as a kid: role-playing games, Zelda, Secret of Mana, all that kind of stuff,\" he tells the site. \"Like, I <em>love</em> fantasy role-playing games.\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems his love of Oblivion was making those early-morning calls to get onto set for filming a little tricky, though. \"So I'm over there in Dublin. I'm, like, having to go to bed at 10pm, because I'm getting up at 6am every morning, and I've got tons of lines, and all that kind of stuff. And I'm just staying up until four in the morning just playing Oblivion.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-game-of-the-year-edition/james-mcavoy-fan\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/terry-pratchett-oblivion-mods\">Terry Pratchett was an Oblivion modder</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/games-as-service-digital-river-report\">The game industry's value has tripled because of DLC and microtransactions</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/bethesda-bugs-culture\">Oblivion designer says Bethesda are \"about not making polish\"</a></p>",

The team behind this ambitious project has continued making progress, and the latest mod development video focuses on some of the stunning landscapes that are now nearing completion. </p><p>According to the new video, the majority of Skyblivion's map is now in the final stages of development, and the work shown so far is seriously impressive. The video discusses how areas such as the forest surrounding the Orange Road have been adapted and improved for the remake. The team decided to make the forest \"more lush and detailed than its original counterpart\" and make it larger to give it a more prominent role in the game, citing the area's ambience and popularity with players as the reason for giving it more attention. </p><p>Blackwood, meanwhile, has been given more fortifications and border gates to add points of interest. The new boggy marsh at the centre of Blackwood, called Blackmarch, looks suitably horrifying and spooky - promising players a subregion full of ruins and decay. The city of Leyawiin has been redesigned from the ground up \"referencing concept art from Oblivion that was likely discarded owing to technical and time limitations\", with the city divided into three distinct sections. Boats are now able to sail right through the city, allowing them to go further inland. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-08-12-skyblivions-landscapes-look-gorgeous-in-the-latest-mod-development-video\">Read more</a></p>",

Like our <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/civilization-vi/civilization-6-mods\">Civ 6 mod</a> guide, we've browsed the internet to cherry pick some of the more interesting and popular user mods available.</p>\n<p>We'll keep looking at this list over time, perhaps add more as we find them or as they are floated to us by the community.

Providing one of the broadest list of victory conditions in any strategy game, Civ 5 can be slightly challenging when trying out new things.</p>\n<p>Civ 5 civilisations are slightly more niche than in the newer Civ VI, creating a clear focus that allows specific nations and specific Civ 5 leaders to achieve their chosen victory condition more easily. There are also more strategies not tied to specific win conditions as well.</p>\n<p>In order to help our readers get better at the game and figure out the best way to achieve their goals and desired play styles, we built this guide to single out the best Civ 5 civs for a range of play styles. Below each entry, you'll also find a summary of what they do best. Alongside this, we've also included their unique faction ability, and how it affects the game. That will hopefully make your game a better experience, and allow you to have much more fun with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v/civ-5-best-civ-leaders\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/glossary\">The PC gaming glossary: every word you need to know to play like a pro</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v/civ-5-superintelligence-mod-cambridge\">Cambridge University sponsor a Civ 5 mod that simulates the AI apocalypse</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/civilization-5/jon-shafer-paradox\">Civilization V director Jon Shafer has left Paradox after just six months</a></p>",

Microsoft's old platform was controversial even at the time, but many games that support it have continued to be sold on Steam and other platforms. However, it seems it's \"no longer possible\" for that to happen with GTA 4.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-iv\">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> was originally created for the Games For Windows Live platform,\" a Rockstar games spokesperson tells us. \"With Microsoft no longer supporting Games For Windows Live, it is no longer possible to generate the additional keys needed to continue selling the current version of the game. We are looking at other options for distributing GTA 4 for PC and will share more information as soon as we can.\"</p>\n<p>If you already on GTA 4 on Steam, you can still access it there - but you can't purchase it there. The standalone DLC collection Episodes from Liberty City, which also uses GFW Live, is still available for purchase on the platform, and you can still get Steam keys for base GTA 4 through third-party sellers like <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/store/grand-theft-auto-iv\">Humble</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/steam\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/gta-4-complete-edition-steam\">GTA 4 returns to Steam as a 'Complete Edition' - without some key features</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/gta-4-loses-songs\">GTA IV soundtrack update nixes Stevie Nicks, David Bowie, and dozens more</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/gta-4-patch-2016\">GTA 4 gets its first patch in six years, making it play nice with Windows 8 and 10</a></p>",

We have lots of juicy news across the board this month, so let's not waste any more time chatting!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png[/img]\n\n[h1][b]PC - RE-LOGIC[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[b][h2]STEAM WORKSHOP NEWS[/h2][/b]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/105600/workshop/][img]https://i.imgur.com/4Wu7N7y.png[/img][/url]\nClick the banner above to check out the Terraria Workshop!\n\nThe level of quality and quantity on the Terraria Steam Workshop just continues to climb - over 20,000 packs and worlds so far, which  is just insane!  If you have not checked out the Workshop yet, what are you waiting for?\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png[/img]\n\n[h2][b]TERRARIA WORKSHOP DEVELOPER'S CHOICE SELECTIONS[/b][/h2]\n\nOur lineup of Developer's Choice picks this time are great in their simplicity and focus on specifics.

We finished up our first jam project and are off onto another very different experiment at this time. The entire process has been a lot of fun and immensely helpful towards exploring ideas, building skills, and improving on how we work together. All of these things will pay huge dividends down the road!\n\nSo, for now, we will have to just continue to ask for your patience and trust in our process as we continue our own journey towards whatever lies ahead.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png[/img]\n\n[h1][b]TMODLOADER NEWS - TML TEAM[/b][/h1]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/][img]https://i.imgur.com/oLHogOc.png[/img][/url]\n\nHello everyone!\n\nAs we shared previously, the tModLoader 1.4 Alpha is out now - you can click the link below to find out more.

August 25th was yesterday, and what a day it was.  Why, you ask?  Well, yesterday we officially pressed the submission buttons for Terraria: Journey's End on PlayStation and Xbox!  Now, we invite all of you to anxiously wait on Sony and Microsoft to complete their review process, after which we will be ready to turn this amazing update over to all of you!\n\n\nWe wish we could be more exact and give you a launch date.  However, the review process is not all that predictable in terms of how long it takes, what might need to be addressed, etc. in each submission.  Rest assured that when we hear something, we will let everyone know just as soon as we can.\n\n\nThis is the final stretch folks - thanks so much for your patience thus far!\n\n\n\n[h2][b]STORIES FROM TESTVILLE[/b][/h2]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/VLcLsUA.png[/img]\n[i]Performance checking with Pumpkin Moon?

Three figures are included in this first set: Dryad, Shadow Armor, and Eye of Cthulhu (with removable iris, to expose its second phase). Skyland does not have its own digital storefront, so they have decided to utilize Kickstarter as their preorder method. The up-front expenses have been paid, the tooling of the steel production molds has already begun, and the factory is ready to produce the figures. This pre-order campaign helps Skyland to judge how many of each figure to produce and ensures that every Terrarian gets the one that they want most!\n\nTo check out the purchase options and to place your order, click the link below or the figure images above to head on over to the Kickstarter page!\n\n[url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyland/terraria-limited-edition-figures-wave-1a/][h3][b]SKYLAND ARTS TERRARIA FIGURES SERIES 1A PREORDER PAGE[/b][/h3][/url]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/CicmbR2.png[/img]\n\n[h2][b]ANIMEGAMI FOREST BIOME UPDATE[/b][/h2]\n\n[previewyoutube=LeNK0CqY8WY;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nPrototype Painting is done and the run-up to preorders for this premium high-end collector's piece is about to begin!

Our goal is to provide a platform where anyone can learn how to help communities and what opportunities are available.\n\nTCT will launch with the following Teams:\n\n1) Art Team: Create art, emotes, memes, stickers, and gifs for communities that can be used for sharing, banners, social media, and events.\n2) Development Team: Create and manage Discord bots and other development projects.\n3) Event Team: Create and manage community events, create custom builds for sandbox games that can be used for parkour, pvp, and other community functions, suggest community events, and receive notification whenever there is an Affiliated community event.\n4) Localization Team: Translate community content into multiple languages and help manage non-English social communities.\n5) Moderator Team: Discuss community moderation, share moderation strategies, assist Affiliated communities with their server moderation.\n6) Partnership Team: Recruit new Affiliated communities to join the TCT and evaluate communities looking to join the TCT.\n7) Quality Assurance Team: Receive notification whenever their is a new game Beta application, report game bugs, and make game suggestions to community officials.\n8) Stream & Video Team: Make video content for communities or stream for communities.\n9) Trivia Team: Help make and review general Trivia questions that are used by communities in activities.\n10) Writing Team: Create editorials for servers to share with their communities and the media.\n\n\nRegistration is now open for partnered and verified servers to join the TCT as an Affiliated community! You must be at least a moderator or admin for a server to apply to have the server join the TCT as an Affiliated community. To apply to become an Affiliated community please message @TCT Mod Mail and include the perma server link, your role in the server, and a brief explanation why you would like the server to join the TCT as an Affiliated community. There will be an interview process for partnered and verified servers to become an Affiliated community.\n\nWe look forward to helping many communities become as great as possible.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/Y3CIX2z.png[/img]\n\nUntil next time, Terrarians - we hope you have an amazing month, and we look forward to bringing you the latest and greatest next time!\n\n",

But now the full schedule has been revealed, it actually sounds like a pretty good time. On the 9th and 10th of July, the virtual Witcher-themed event will hold panels with the likes of Henry Cavill, chatting about deep lore, trivia, quizzes and updates on the upcoming Witcher TV shows.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-whats-on-at-witchercon-next-week\">Read more</a></p>",

CD Projekt Red and Netflix have just announced that they're partnering up for their own online event to talk about all things Witcher in July. Well, not <i>all</i> things Witcher. They won't be announcing The Witcher 4 or anything like that, they've already warned. This all came out alongside a rather tiny new teaser trailer for Netflix's The Witcher season 2. Perhaps WitcherCon will reveal a longer one of those, at least.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-go-expecting-a-new-witcher-game-announcement-at-witchercon\">Read more</a></p>",

Creator Edmund McMillen had previously hoped the team would manage to get the game out <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-binding-of-isaac/repentance-steam-release-date\">before the end of 2020</a>, but that wasn't to be - given, well, everything about that year, it's kind of remarkable the delay was only three months.</p>\n<p>\"Me and the team are quite excited for this beast to finally rise from the depths and consume your every waking hour for the years to come,\" Edmund writes in <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/2931245981718356331\">an accompanying blog on Steam</a>. \"We just want all of its features to be perfect and testing to be a bit more in-depth than our last little release that will go unnamed.\" Some 11 more blogs will be posted between now and launch, exploring the features and additions players can expect before diving in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-binding-of-isaac/repentance-release-date-steam\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-binding-of-isaac/repentance-steam-release-date\">The Binding of Isaac: Repentance is \"sequel-sized\" DLC expected to launch in 2020</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/nicalis-controversy\">Binding of Isaac creator drops future plans to work with Nicalis after reports of exploitation</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-binding-of-isaac/four-souls-retail-edition\">The Binding of Isaac card game spinoff is now available at Target</a></p>",

We have all considered life as a cop, super sleuth, or detective, for a brief moment. Whether drawn in by the position of authority, the puzzling case work, or even the hard drinking: police games deliver plenty of action and intrigue.</p>\n<p>However, cop games are not all about John Woo-esque shootouts and high-speed car chases, and in fact, the best police games often see you digging through crime scenes for evidence and carrying out routine procedures rather than pursuing perps, gun drawn.</p>\n<p>To help you find the right police games for you, we have assembled a list that encompasses every aspect of the job, from hard-boiled <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-detective-games\">detective games</a>, to cop simulations that immerse you in life on the beat - not to mention a sprinkling of unconventional picks to keep things interesting. We come back to our lists often to add new games and ensure you're getting the very best cop games around.

Oh, and a whole lot of shrines offering handy status effects, too, of course. Now, some modders are looking to put a whole new spin on this element of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-fantasy-games-pc\">fantasy game</a> with a \"complete overhaul\" of its religion system.</p>\n<p>The mod is called Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul and, among other changes, it \"adds dozens of new deities and with powerful shrine effects to the game\", as creators Simon Magus and Tate Taylor explain on the mod's page. The mod adds two perks to the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc\">RPG game</a> that essentially breaks out religion into two types: pilgrims and cultists. The former is found in the game's restoration skill tree and is linked to the more benevolent gods like the Divines, their chief god Auri-El, and the Skaaal of Solstheim's deity All-Maker. The cultist branch, on the other hand, is tied to the malevolent Deadra, the 'worm king' Mannimarco, and the 'dread father' Sithis.</p>\n<p>These perks have two ranks, with a level 30 one doubling the strength of shrines' effects, and the other at 60 offering an additional bonus effect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/mod-religion-overhaul\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/fishing\">Skyrim gets a free anniversary update with fishing</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/card-ride-intro-bug\">Skyrim's iconic cart intro was nearly ruined by a bee</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/whiterun-minecraft-build\">A Skyrim fan has recreated Whiterun in Minecraft and it's spot on</a></p>",

Skyrim: Anniversary Edition is set to launch later this year, alongside a free update for the game. That free update will upgrade the console editions for the next generation, but more importantly, it adds a new feature for all platforms, including PC: fishing.</p>\n<p>Yes, there will soon be an official fishing minigame in Skyrim. The feature was demonstrated during today's QuakeCon stream. You'll apparently walk up to a set of fishing supplies near a body of water, hit a button, and then be entered into the fishing minigame. The details of the mechanics aren't quite clear, but we do see a player catch a \"pogfish\" - and I'm not sure if I love it or hate it.</p>\n<p>\"You don't have to dive in the water and click blindly anymore,\" managing director Ashley Cheng explains. \"You can now grab a fishing pole, do some fishing quests.

It's certainly the best Warhammer 40K game, although as far as 'old school' Relic goes Company of Heroes is considered the better game, in many respects.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed it would get several expansions, the most recent of which being the 2008 stand-alone release called Soulstorm, which built on Dark Crusades' campaign layer but made it across an entire star system. We'd also get full sequels in the shape of Dawn of War II and Dawn of War III, but the original holds strong above them all.</p>\n<p>12 years later, this aged strategy game is being kept alive thanks to its modding community. Mods are the life-blood of any strategy fanbase and are what allow these games to remain popular over long periods of time, like we've seen with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-empire-at-war-gold-pack/mods-best\">Star Wars: Empire at War</a>. It can even inspire developers to renew support for an older game, like what creative assembly did for <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-rome-ii/best-rome-2-mods\">Total War: Rome 2</a>. Coming back to Dawn of War, we've done some digging to find the most popular mods helping keep the game live after all this time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dawn-of-war-mods-best\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-cinematic-intros\">Watch the 8 best cinematic game intros of all time - like films but shorter and better</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/relic-pluck-dawn-war-games-maws-gamespy-and-games-windows-live\">Relic pluck Dawn of War games from the maws of Gamespy and Games for Windows Live</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dawn-war-sequel-strong-possibility-relic-despite-sega-sale\">Dawn of War sequel a \"strong possibility\" from Relic despite Sega sale</a></p>",

There was a weird, brief time when it looked like they <em>might</em> happen around 2005, seemingly off the back of a wave of appreciation for Total War, when they started popping up in everything from other RTS games to the original Star Wars Battlefront 2. But then - poof! - gone. </p><p>I would very much like them to come back. It's taken me a while to realise but conquest modes are often the secret ingredient to some of my most beloved games, home to my most beloved pre-adolescent memories. Not to be confused with the tickets-and-control-points Conquest mode in Battlefield, which is fun but not what I'm on about, the conquest mode I'm talking about is where you get a big, often slightly silly layer over the top of the \"actual\" game itself, in the form of a map with regions or planets or whatever that you strategize over capturing, and fight over down on the real-time ground itself. A metagame, if we must use that word: a driving, continuous reason to keep playing the game, but essentially one that is also a game itself, as opposed to just a path of XP unlocks or a paid-for pass. </p><p>A favourite of mine - if we're excluding Total War, which is sort what you get if you make an entire series of conquest modes, where the mode itself is fleshed-out and maximised to its logical conclusion - is the one that came in the Dawn of War: Dark Crusade expansion, which frankly had no right to be so good. The story here, if you chose the Space Marines, is that you've landed on some xeno planet and just about every other intergalactic race (there are seven of them) just happens to show up as well. If you play as the Necrons, it's a bunch of rowdy neighbours moving in and waking you up. If you're the Tau then apparently you think this planet's yours. Everyone's here, basically. Orks! Imperial Guard! Chaos! More! For some time since, quoting the hyper-committed narrator's \"...and then the Eldar came!\" has been a running joke with friends. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-06-20-put-a-conquest-mode-in-everything\">Read more</a></p>",

As clocks rolled over to 2021, one of the developers behind the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-15-best-indie-games-on-pc\">indie games</a> spoke a little about his new project, and it sounds exactly like you'd expect.</p>\n<p>In a vague tweet, Jonatan Söderström says the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/upcoming-pc-games\">upcoming game</a> is something a little more personal, and that reactions will likely be extreme, and mixed. \"I wish I could write about what we're working on,\" He says. \"It is a passion project so I'm not sure who will enjoy it. But I'm sure some people will be horrified and others delighted!\"</p>\n<p>Since it's 2021, that means it's nine years since Hotline Miami first launched. The surreal, ultra-violent <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-action-adventure-games\">action-adventure game</a> was a massive hit on PC and console, helping put Devolver Digital on the map as a publisher. Söderström and developer Dennaton Games made a follow-up, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, released in 2015. The team added a level editor in 2016, and the enduring popularity led to a port of the Hotline Miami Collection to Nintendo Switch in 2019, and the aforementioned systems last year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hotline-miami/next-game\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/humble-indie-bundle-21\">Humble Indie Bundle 21 has more cheap PC games for Humble's ten-year anniversary</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hotline-miami-3-teaser\">The Hotline Miami 3 teaser was \"a prank that went way further than I thought it would\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hotline-miami/hotline-miami-3d\">This horror dev reimagined Hotline Miami as a PS1-era classic</a></p>",

I can still feel it. What a cutting, embarrassingly necessary parable of violence. What a way to stand on the shoulders of Shadow of the Colossus, by taking that moral throughline and wrapping it, head to toe, in the trappings of its time.</p><p>What's weird, though, is I think parables are a bit rubbish. More often than not a parable will do somewhere between most and all of the work for you. You'll finish up - watching, reading, playing, whatever - and you'll know exactly what it is that you just consumed, what the point of it was, and what you need to do next, which is usually nothing. </p><p>Hotline Miami, a lot of the time, is at real threat of falling into that trap. You are summoned, via anonymous phone call, into a series of ultra-violent raids on various bad guy hideouts, and you obviously oblige. It's 2012 so naturally, Drive still fresh in the mind, this is set in the late '80s. It's a cult hit because it's indie and violent and has music, and the cult following has nicknamed your character \"Jacket\", because he has a cool jacket. Everything is neon, but a sort of grim neon, with a dirty, grainy flicker over the top that could be a sort of VHS effect or could be a glaring sign, as it gradually flickers with more vigor and grunge, that what you're seeing here isn't entirely real.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-28-games-of-the-decade-hotline-miami-filth-fetish-and-the-only-video-game-parable\">Read more</a></p>",

Truly, the best of times. Patagon: The Forbidden Island remembers, and so is ready to take you on a Dishonored and Bioshock-style adventure through jurassic jungles and steampunk skies in an open-world RPG, with optional VR support.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc\">RPG game</a>, described by developer Joren Winge as a \"steampunk open-world VR adventure game\" is <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jorenwinge/the-forbidden-island-the-steampunk-rpg-for-vr-and-desktop\">currently raising funds on Kickstarter.</a> Players will enter an \"alternate steampunk reality\", where \"Zeppelins have replaced ships\". You play as an ex-army lieutenant-turned-hunter, about to tangle with the deadliest animal of all: not man, obviously, but massive dinosaurs.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is set to be a mix of action, stealth, and puzzles. As for weapons, what steampunk game would be complete without some awesome-sounding weapons that don't really make much sense, but that's fine because 'Tesla did it'? Here, there's the Tesla gun and steam rifle, plus a whole snuffbox of traps, bombs, and explosives. We're, er, getting less confident in these dinos by the minute.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dishonored/patagon-forbidden-island\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/Games-Done-Quick/Games-Done-Quick-AGDQ-2018-Schedule\">Awesome Games Done Quick's complete January 2018 schedule has been released</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dishonored/dishonored-co-creative-director-hopeful-future-complex-pc-multiplatform-games\">Dishonored co-creative director \"hopeful\" for future of complex, PC-like multiplatform games</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dishonored/dishonored-game-year-edition-trailer-tempts-return-dunwall\">Dishonored: Game of the Year Edition trailer tempts a return to Dunwall</a></p>\n",

Developed by [url=https://hyperstrange.com/]Hyperstrange[/url] (developers of ELDERBORN) and [url=https://www.creativeforge.pl/]CreativeForge Games[/url] to be published by Running With Scissors, POSTAL: Brain Damaged gives a tantalizing taste of the madness to come in its [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Wdy5sJZQU&feature=youtu.be]debut trailer[/url], revealed today at [url=https://2yuce.r.bh.d.sendibt3.com/mk/cl/f/RWtpyRjsxcYKhnKoMPgnnA214tDXHBl4ZQSre1PwHykLNCMFRqZLfp8Ssku3fFScFq7T7Gs5-qUSW07ELXyoMdPCm66Wka9uQNdNEOA3j9XyCpRevRz2iI2EeTeGLJ2JB66YXRCNl-jnDN53DK3c_lw_4kKtzXmIzJ8]Realms Deep 2020[/url].\n\nOne too many hits to the head (and hits off the pipe) has everyone’s favorite bathrobed anti-hero, The POSTAL Dude, reeling from brain damage. When he closes his eyes in a drunken, drugged-up stupor, he awakens in a psychedelic, grotesque, utterly twisted dream world. Asylum patients with dildo arms charge ravenously. Serial killer grandmas wield walkers in cut-throat combat. Beware probe-happy aliens reaching for the backside of The POSTAL Dude’s bathrobe.\n\nShoot through stages of escalating insanity, beating back the nightmares with bullets and urine. Strafe, dash, slide, and bunny hop through massive retro-styled stages, including a grungy asylum, comic convention, Area 69, and more. Each of The POSTAL Dude’s twisted fantasies offers new challenges and a characteristic flow — from corridor shooting through secret passages to blowing up large, open spaces with perfect twitch reflexes — but the hardcore spirit of badass ‘90s shooters bleeds from every orifice.\n\nWith a heaping arsenal of nostalgic, bombastic weaponry, POSTAL: Brain Damaged delivers a pure boomer shooter experience. Eviscerate enemies with the double-barreled shotgun, remove flat-earther heads from afar with the devastating railgun, and attach the cat silencer to blast aliens and military zombies with feline style.\n\n[i]POSTAL: Brain Damaged[/i] boasts the series’ beloved over-the-top parody and satire of pop culture, politics, and modern society. Escape from reality and unwind while beating back hippies, fleeing from flying fluids, and wiping out enemies to your heart’s content while pixelated blood spurts forth and a thrashing old school soundtrack thumps with every gun blast.\n\n“They just don’t make badass shooters like they used to,” said Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors. \"Brain Damaged takes the torch from all the pretenders while excreting everything fans want to see from the series that once birthed “The Worst Game Ever™”. The Dude is back and dirtier than ever!”\n\n[previewyoutube=6wu4sdkzGQo;full][/previewyoutube]\n\nPOSTAL: Brain Damaged launches for PC and consoles in 2021.

On the one hand, it delivers a night and day improvement in every regard compared to the original Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console releases, but on the other, the reality is that it's essentially a straight port of the existing PC game. And perhaps there's a reason why this is dubbed the Classic Edition as opposed to, say, Far Cry 3 Remastered - because as far as I can see, the only actual changes made to the core content seems to be restricted to adding the work 'classic' to the logo.</p><p>In theory at least though, a straight PC port isn't necessarily a bad thing - for two reasons. First of all, Far Cry 3 itself as a game still holds up visually in the current-gen era and it plays extremely well. A spectacular improvement over its predecessor, it was the first Ubisoft Far Cry game that truly delivered an open world (Far Cry 2 was constructed more as a series of play areas linked by 'corridors'), its gunplay, melee and hunting mechanics worked beautifully, and while the sandbox is there to do with as you will, the narrative thread and variety in the tasks asked of you remains compelling - even today. </p><p>Secondly, Ubisoft Montreal pushed the Dunia Engine hard with this game - too hard, perhaps. Performance was sometimes shocking poor and the wobbly frame-rate and constant screen-tearing of the last-gen console releases is the stuff of legend. And that's despite the development team using every trick in the book to somehow downsize a vastly superior PC game onto those machines. A range of techniques was deployed to claw back resources, from slightly reduced resolutions for better memory management, lower resolution alpha effects, and plenty more. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-far-cry-classic-is-a-barebones-pc-port\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>",

And let's not even talk about how quickly my fat fingers fail at the psychedelic Super Hexagon. Terry Cavanagh's notorious for laying out challenges of immense difficulty—what will happen when he sinks his hands into the puzzle genre? We'll be finding out soon.<br />\n<br />\nOver on his Distractionware blog, Cavanagh has posted a screenshot of his next work-in-progress, a puzzle game with the oh-so-appropriate working title Halting Problem. Something tells me that the simple level layout and the happy little dude are not indicative of the near-frustrating challenges we will be posed.<br />\n<br />\nPuzzling is something I actually quizzed Cavanagh on a couple of years ago, and he has some rather strict opinions on what actually constitutes a puzzle game; he feels that the term has been misapplied with some of his previous work.<br />\n<br />\n\"I don't really consider the challenges in VVVVVV 'puzzles,'\" Cavanagh told me in an email. \"I think the term 'puzzle' gets thrown around in games all the time for things that aren't really puzzles, like Tetris or whatever.\"<br />\n<br />\nDespite his own work having shied away from puzzling territory, he's long been a proponent of games such as DROD, who he cites as an influence on Halting Problem; it'll be exciting, and possibly a little terrifying, to see what Cavanagh can accomplish in the puzzle genre.",

How nice of them. I hope you've hidden your wallet after last time, because there are some cracking deals to be had, including Super Hexagon, Binding of Isaac and Terraria for silly money.<br />\n<br />\nThere's no countdown, so I'm assuming the many games on sale are going to stay the same price until the sale ends on March 29th (the 'Featured' games will likely rotate day by day, without offering any additional savings). There's a lot of games going cheap - more than is evident from the main page - so be sure to poke around for the ones you're interested in. Here are few of the better offers:<br />\n<br />\n\tFTL - £3.49 (50% off)<br />\n\tHotline Miami - £3.49 (50% off)<br />\n\tTo The Moon - £2.79 (60% off)<br />\n\tAmnesia: The Dark Descent - £3.24 (75% off)<br />\n\tMiasmata - £5.99 (50% off)<br />\n\tLone Survivor - £3.39 (50% off)<br />\n\tThe Blackwell Bundle - £3.74 (75% off)<br />\n\tRetro City Rampage - £3.99 (67% off)<br />\n\tUltratron, which came out like yesterday - £3.49 (50% off)<br />\n\tEuro Truck Simulator 2 - £12.49 (50% off)<br />\n",

The demos are pretty generous, offering access to a good number of environments, modes, tracks and the full editing suite in both games, although this unlimited access will expire after 48 hours, to be replaced with something perhaps a little more reasonable (an hour of play every day, or more if the player count falls below 100). Head here to check out the TrackMania 2 demo, and here to check out the ShootMania one, or stick around to hear exactly what you'll be getting.<br />\n<br />\nDownload the free trial of ShootMania and you'll be given access to the following:<br />\n<br />\n\t3 multiplayer ranked modes: Battle, Elite &amp; Siege<br />\n\tFull multiplayer experience (Nadeo and user-created gamemodes and Title Packs)<br />\n\tAccess to all editors (Map, MediaTracker (Video), Actions &amp; Weapons, Items)<br />\n\tCustom Titles: solo &amp; multiplayer innovative modes<br />\n<br />\nTrackMania 2, meanwhile, has the following to offer:<br />\n<br />\n\t45 white solo tracks<br />\n\tAccess to the TrackMania   multi-environment title (Canyon + Valley + Stadium at the same time!)(1)<br />\n\tFull multiplayer experience (Nadeo and user-created gamemodes and Title Packs)<br />\n\tAccess to all editors (Map, MediaTracker (Video), Actions &amp; Weapons, Items)<br />\n\tUp to 3 user made solo &amp; multiplayer experiences<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks, Blue's News.",

If you’ve never tried the insanity that is a Trackmania race, head over to the Maniaplanet website to download.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTrackmania specializes in allowing, and encouraging, the construction of absurd, physics-bending tracks within a themed environment. We generally liked Canyons when it was released in 2012, and this year Nadeo unleashed the Valley and Stadium expansions upon players.<br />\n<br />\nAll three of Trackmania 2’s incarnations are available on Steam, and for the next few days they’re on sale for 50% off. I recommend that you check them out if you haven't played a racing game in a while.",

Once you try one, though, there’s no going back. I’ve been a big fan of ultrawide gaming monitors for years now, mostly because supported PC games just look fantastic on them. And that’s why I’ve put together this list of the best ultrawide games on PC – to show you exactly what they look like in the flesh, complete with GIFs and photos of them running on an ultrawide monitor so you can see them in motion with your own peepers.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/18/the-35-best-ultrawide-pc-games/#more-913873\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading The 35 best ultrawide games on PC\">(more…)</span></a></p>\n",

According to the press release about the new 2K-founded studio Cloud Chamber, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-announced/\">wot is making a brand new BioShock</a>, it&#8217;s &#8220;iconic, first-person shooter gameplay&#8221;. Before <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/bioshock-infinite\">Binfinite</a> came out, original series lead Ken Levine said in an interview that it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sjUb1pn7o5w\">&#8220;incredibly detailed world&#8221;</a> each game lets you explore. Or maybe it&#8217;s the PoLiTiCs? BioShock, famously, includes a pretty basic critique of the wet fart that is Objectivism, causing people either to argue it was a searing work of political genius, or be furious that it <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a work of searing political genius. Perhaps it&#8217;s the settings? BioShock and <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/bioshock-2\">BioShock 2</a> were set in an underwater city, and Infinite was set in a floating one. I can only assume the new one will just be about a normal city. But <em>run on centrist principles</em>. The most dystopian system of them all!</p>\n<p>But of course, none of these things are really the hallmark of a BioShock game. What truly makes the series stand out is that you can shoot flying animals out of your hand, because of DNA. And I think we all know what that animal should be used as ammunition in the new BioShock. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/10/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand/#more-766579\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading BioShock 4 should let you fire an albatross from your hand\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n",

The new BioShock is being made by Cloud Chamber, a new studio who&#8217;ll be working on the game &#8220;for the next several years.&#8221; Don&#8217;t hold your breath.

(Alternatively: my commiserations on your wounded bank balance, but at least you have a load of new games to play.) If you thought that might be it for cheap PC games until Valve's annual&nbsp;Spring shindig, then boy were you wrong: here were are, just two days later, and Humble have come up trumps again. Their latest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Bundle</a> is all about 'eye candy' games, and to that end they've collected the scrumptious&nbsp;Year Walk, the lovely&nbsp;Lovely Planet, and handsome&nbsp;handmade shmup The Blue Flamingo, with Dust, Mind: Path to Thalamus, and poetic survival game Eidolon thrown in too if you choose to&nbsp;beat the average. Finally, a payment of $10 will secure a copy of musical puzzler&nbsp;FRACT OSC.</p><p>We don't have reviews of all these games up on the site, but if you're wondering what we thought of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/lovely-planet-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Lovely Planet</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/dust-an-elysian-tail-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/fract-osc-review/\" target=\"_blank\">FRACT OSC</a>, we were pleased, slightly more pleased, and a bit *does wavey hand motion* with them respectively. In a stroke of good fortune, I didn't own any of those games before purchasing this bundle, and I'm particularly looking forward to giving Eidolon a try. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                                "contents": "[h1]Hello Heisters![/h1]\n\nToday we bring you a smaller update focused on the game’s meta. Specifically for low damage assault rifles, also in this update, there are some performance optimizations for the shotguns. There are also a few tweaks to specific weapons, like the concealment of the RPK to allow for crit build and a buff to the ammo pool of the Lebensauger .308. Check out the patch notes for all changes and tweaks.\n\nBut that is not all, there are also some interesting tweaks in regards to scopes, both how they function in-game and additional info while in the menus. Finally, we’ve improved the lighting in the weapon customization view, so your guns will look their best while you tinker and tailor them to your needs and desires.\n\nAnd another note for the Dead by Daylight heisters out there, we've talked to our previous partners in crime over at Behaviour Interactive and together we now have made the Feeder and Dendron masks available to anyone who owns the base game of Dead by Daylight. Previously you had to own the Deluxe Edition, but since that edition is no longer available we wanted to make sure the masks were still easily obtainable. If you haven't tried these horrific masks, now's your chance!\n\n[h1]Shotguns[/h1]\nEach shotgun fires a number of pellets (hit rays). If one or more of these would hit an enemy the weapon’s damage is applied. This means that if multiple rays hit an enemy it still applies the same amount of damage as if only one ray would hit the enemy. These rays can be very performance-heavy. We have adjusted the number of rays per weapon based on the damage class. Higher damage weapons and slower firing weapons will keep a higher number of rays. Fast-firing and low damaging weapons will have fewer rays. This will yield improved performance, especially on older machines running games with multiple shotguns present. The Joceline O/U 12G, Mosconi 12G, and Claire 12G Shotguns will remain unaffected.\n\n[h1]Assault Rifles[/h1]\nWe have also looked at some of our Assault Rifles. We want to bring up the DPS of the low damage class of assault rifles in order for them to be more balanced against their mid damage counterparts. To achieve this, we’ve increased the damage for the low damage class. We’ve also addressed the long reload times on some weapons. This issue has been addressed in different ways depending on the weapon. Some weapons have had their reload time reduced, others have had their total ammo increased or an additional damage buff.\n\n[h1]Scopes[/h1]\nAnother change you certainly will notice is the scopes. We’ve altered the look of the scope while you ADS to give a better view through the optics. This will let you see more of the battlefield downrange as less will be obscured by the sight itself. Looking at the stats block in the menus, you will now see the strength on the scope listed as the scope’s zoom level.[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/4458711/6dfdf68fb7feab3dce0aff9fa547931423453554.png[/img][i]Compact Tactical Box Sight, before and after scope changes[/i]\n\n\n\nLet’s put some rounds down range and dominate the battlefield.\n[b]OVERKILL_Tobias[/b]\n[url=https://twitter.com/overkill_tm]OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio.[/url]\n\n[h1]Update 210 Changelog[/h1]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/218620/view/2951533817925959120]Find the Changelog Here![/url]",

In the steam library; right click on PAYDAY 2. Select \"Properties\" from the menu. Under the tab \"LOCAL FILES\" select \"VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES...\".\nThe process may take some time to finish.\n\n\n\nKeep those helmets flying.\n[b]OVERKILL_Tobias[/b]\n[url=https://twitter.com/overkill_tm]OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio.[/url]",

                                "contents": "[h2]Underwater Labs Improvements[/h2]\n\nSince the Underwater Labs release, we've been following your feedback closely. The majority of feedback was surrounding high loot density and lack of player interaction. We've now reduced the map Labs count from 6 to 3, removed red and blue keycard spawns, additionally loot crates will no longer spawn while players are nearby. \n\nTo suit the reduced total number of underwater labs per map, we increased the smallest allowed size per underwater lab. You will no longer find underwater labs that are only a couple of rooms in size, so they should all be worth a visit.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/moonpool_small_exterior.jpg[/img]\n\nMany of you have certainly noticed that the moonpool water was bullet proof. This was an unintended effect from the complexities of dealing with the water carving volumes and has now been fixed.\n\nSpeaking of moonpools, a human sized version has been added in the mix to allow for more points of entry in the labs.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210827/moonpool_small_interior.jpg[/img]\n\nFinally, we addressed a number of small glitches in the procedural generation that could cause corridor, iceberg and vegetation overlaps.\n\n\n[h2]SUBMARINES[/h2]\n\n[h3]Storage[/h3]\nBoth types of submarine now have storage with 12 slots.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/substorage_solo1.jpg[/img]\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/substorage_duo1.jpg[/img]\n\n[h3]Torpedoes[/h3]\nThe Surface torpedo has been removed due to players camping underwater with little to no risk. Torpedoes can still be fired at surface targets by surfacing the submarine and firing a standard torpedo.\n\n[h3]Oxygen[/h3]\nSubmarines also now need to surface for air every ten minutes, either on the ocean's surface or in a moon pool. Otherwise, after ten minutes you'll start taking slow damage.\n\nAs part of implementing this change, I've revamped the oxygen UI a bit, and you can now see how much time you have left from a diving tank as well.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen_sub.gif[/img] [img]https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen_diving.gif[/img]  [img]https://files.facepunch.com/billb/1b3011b1/oxygen.gif[/img]\n\n[h3]Other[/h3]\nThe rear passenger in a duo sub can now turn all the way around. Sonar blips only show up for other running subs, not every sub that's parked in someone's base. And subs stop moving a lot more quickly when someone dismounts, meaning they won't run away on you if you accidentally dismount underwater.\n\nSubmarines now take additional damage from bullets. \n\n\n[h2]Fishing Village Shop[/h2]\nA custom shop has been added inside the fishing villages to accommodate all your fishing gear needs. \n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/fishingvillage_store1.jpg[/img]\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/paddy/20210828/fishingvillage_store2.jpg[/img]\n\n[h3]Improvements & Fixes Highlights[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Crawling Health - Crawling health is reduced by 75%\n[*] Swimming Gestures - Can now use non dance gestures while swimming\n[*] Shooting Players Underwater - Fixed projectiles dealing no damage to players underwater\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2]Gravis Island[/h2]\nGravis Island is running for the final month across Facepunch official servers, here is the map change lists:\n[list]\n[*] Fixed Floating rocks\n[*] Removed offshore topology from ocean villages Roughed up the edge of the offshore topology to remove the straight line of ocean plants\n[*] Smoothed out some spiky ocean terrain Tidied up mainland topo + removed it from very small landmasses in ocean\n[*] Tidied up underwater splat Edited terrain around harbour slightly, some areas were floating\n[*] Added more ladder triggers to harbour Fixed some areas of alpha\n[*] Patched some more Floating rocks with gaps allowing for sneaky sneaky. Adjusted some Splat in a few areas were the texture effects in game were rough.\n[*] Fixed the terrain difference at Power plant with a few floating objects. Reduced the beach topology on the sand peninsulas so spawn points aren't as focal to one area\n[*] Applied river topology to the two northern ponds/lakes for fresh water Removed the blue metal crate from fishing village since it's nearly impossible to get out if you jump in.\n[*] Added large rock formation to the middle of the larger secluded island for more natural cover since it was quite bare with just trees/bushes \n[*] Made several small pathways up the rock faces on the beaches where players spawn so they won't have to travel as far to go inland from the cliff face\n[*] Added prevent build volumes to the tunnel near mil tuns since somehow i missed that previously\n[*] Replaced all crates with the new native spawners\n[*] Added splat on a couple rocks \n[*] Reduced Labs to 3\n[/list]\nIf you're a server owner and wish to host your own Gravis Island map then check out the [url=https://lone.design/product/gravis-island/]official site.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]RGB Integration[/h2]\n\nFor people with Razer and/or SteelSeries hardware, we have added some RGB keyboard effects for different states in the game.\n[list]\n[*] Blue breathing effect when too cold\n[*] Red breathing effect when too hot\n[*] Flash red when hurt / damage taken\n[*] Flash red continuously when below 25% HP\n[*] Flash red rapid continues when downed / crawling\n[*] Flashing green when radiated\n[*] Solid white when in building privilege area\n[*] Green breathing when 25%+ comfort\n[/list]\nIf you'd rather keep your custom rainbow effects enabled while playing Rust then this integration can be turned off at any time in the Rust options menu, in the general Options tab (scroll down - it's below Physics). You'll also find an option for brightness there.\n\nAlso, for anyone who loves RGB and custom binds, there is a console command which will make your RGBs flash a custom color for however long you wish. The following will flash it purple for 0.2 seconds: rgbeffects.pulse 255,0,255 0.2\n\n\n[h2]NVIDIA Reflex Update[/h2]\n\nIn May we added support for Nvidia Reflex which reduced system latency by up to 38%, but now that number is even higher with the release of the Reflex SDK 1.5 update.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/02/0P47B1/rust-nvidia-reflex-geforce-system-latency-optimizations.png[/img]\n\nRead more [url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/nvidia-reflex-rust-escape-from-tarkov-optimizations/]here.[/url]\n\n[h2]Twitch Drops[/h2]\n\nStarting from today till September 9th 18:00UTC Twitch drops are enabled for Rust Twitch streamers. You can earn special and unique skins simply by watching your favourite Rust Twitch streamers.\n\nWe've teamed up with Blazed, Jewer, Eltk, CNDBLOOD, Terpsicat, Elxocas, Agustabell212, Silithur, Ricoy23 and Kira to bring you special unique drops which can only be earned by watching their channels.\n\n[img]https://files.facepunch.com/Alistair/09/02/5f75u1/SVcuS_FY.jpg[/img]\n\nDuring the final 24 hours of the Rust Twitch drop campaign, all drops will be moved to general. \n\nLearn more at [url=https://twitch.facepunch.com/]twitch.facepunch.com.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Change List[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Added smaller moonpools to underwater labs\n[*] Added a new store front to fishing village's equipment shop\n[*] Can now use non dance gestures while swimming\n[*] If player is holding S when they catch a fish, block backwards movement for 1s or until the S key is released\n[*] Added global.usersinrange admin convar\n[*] Fixed console not properly scrolling through all of it's lines (used to show ~250 lines, should now show all 500)\n[*] New \"combatlog_outgoing\" convar to get a combatlog of only outgoing damage\n[*] Thrown cassette recorders now decay\n[*] Inventory item description now scales to better fit long descriptions\n[*] Reduced explosion forces on minicopter and scrap transport heli by ~95%. Stop getting knocked around so much by SAM sites\n[*] Both submarine types now have storage\n[*] Now only showing sonar blips for other subs if those subs have their engine running\n[*] Submarines stop moving a lot faster when the driver dismounts - prevent runaway subs and drowning risk when dismounting by mistake\n[*] Submarines now need to surface once every ten minutes, can't hide underwater forever\n[*] Rear passenger in duo sub can now turn all the way around\n[*] Submarine driving now adds to the boating stat\n[*] Increased minimum allowed size of the underwater labs\n[*] Renamed crawlingminhealth to crawlingminimumhealth and crawlingmaxhealth to crawlingmaximumhealth\n[*] Added 21 new prefabs for map makers\n[*] Removed blue and red card lab spawns from underwater labs\n[*] Player crawling health reduced by 75%\n[*] Added chocolate bar world model\n[*] Bullets now deal slightly more damage to submarines\n[*] Fixed not being able to gesture while on a sofa\n[*] Fixed rare case where player eyes would appear incorrectly\n[*] Fixed rotor on CH47 map marker not rotating\n[*] Fixed case where players could access scrap on slot machine incorrectly\n[*] Fixed toggling lights causing issues while gesturing\n[*] Fixed paddling animation blending issue (boogie boards, kayaks, inner tubes)\n[*] Underwater crates now have 12 item slots, fixes rare case where underwater crates would spawn with > 6 items and an item would be cut off\n[*] Fixed dances continuing after mounting a vehicle\n[*] Fixed fish line getting snapped when the player is standing too far back from a ledge (players now have to stand closer to the edge)\n[*] Fixed WorkCarts decaying in the maintenance tunnel where they spawn\n[*] Fixed bullet proof moonpool water at underwater labs\n[*] Fixed icebergs sometimes overlapping underwater labs\n[*] Fixed vegetation sometimes clipping into underwater labs\n[*] Fixed underwater lab 45 degree corridors sometimes overlapping each other\n[*] Fixed server.maxconnectionsperip convar not working\n[*] Fixed floating crates in airfield\n[*] Fixed items dropping inside locker when stacked\n[*] Fixed Two Sided Ornate Hanging Sign inconsistent crafting time\n[*] Fixed T stacking small signs\n[*] Removed rising torpedo type\n[/list]",

Now, it's time to look ahead and see what else is on the horizon. Rust YouTuber Shadowfrax has posted a clip offering us the rundown of what's in the pipeline right now, and it includes some nerfs for the newly added submarines, \"some kind of military camp\", and those missions that have been mentioned in the past.</p>\n<p>In Shadowfrax's latest Rust update (below) the YouTuber notes that after the next patch you should see torpedoes get slapped with a bit of a nerf. Torpedoes will get a larger 'aimcone' with less accuracy over distance. Plus, a change is coming that'll add a small puff of smoke to the submarine when it fires a shot to signal where it came from - so, it sounds like they'll be a tad less sneaky once that's be rolled out.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the 'Tuber notes that in Rust's game commits, there's a new branch tied to 'submarine oxygen' which indicates some changes aimed at changing how long you can stay holed away in your sub. It seems that, going by these, you'll need to make sure you surface and get some air every so often, or keep a diving tank on you. Rust's drowning status is getting a rename to 'low oxygen' to reflect this adjustment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/submarine-changes-missions\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/going-deep-update\">Rust is getting an underwater biome, underwater dungeons, and fishing</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sharks-submarines-spearguns\">Shark Week is coming to Rust, permanently</a></p>",

Developer Facepunch Studios has revealed that this month's Going Deep update introduces an underwater biome with procedural underwater lab dungeons, submarines, torpedoes, sharks, spear guns, fishing, and underwater ambience effects.</p>\n<p>You'll find the new underwater labs on the ocean floor in a variety of shapes and sizes. You can access two entry points with a submarine to find various puzzles, enemies, and loot. If you fancy doing some prep ahead of time, you can connect to a vast network of CCTV cameras. Want some downtime? The mess hall room might have a selection of high stakes poker, music, and cooking for you to engage with with your group.</p>\n<p>Speaking of submarines, you'll be able to buy those from the boat shops at fishing villages. A two-person sub has internal fuel access and an instrument cluster, including rudimentary sonar, whereas the single-person sub doesn't have any instruments. Both subs do, though, have torpedoes, so have fun with that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/going-deep-update\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/sharks-submarines-spearguns\">Shark Week is coming to Rust, permanently</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/crawling-wounded\">Rust due to get new wounded and recovery mechanics next update</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/rust/skins-weekly-new-items\">Rust skins - here are this week's new items</a></p>",

With Psyonix now under the Epic Games umbrella, the rocket-powered, battle car multiplayer experience is set for a technical upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.</p>\n<p>Revealed in a job description on <a href=\"https://epicgames.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Psyonix_Careers/job/San-Diego-CA/Marketing-Copywriter_R5008\">Psyonix's website</a> (which has now been edited), the developer mentions that the marketing copywriter it is looking for will help on future projects for the team. These include the mobile version of the game, <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/rocket-league/sideswipe-mobile-game\">Rocket: League Sideswipe</a>, and \"Rocket League's move to UE5\" (Unreal Engine 5).</p>\n<p>A member of the Psyonix development team also elaborated on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/p7oyyf/rocket_league_moving_to_unreal_engine_5_confirmed/h9lqm9m/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\">Reddit</a>, saying that moving the game to Unreal Engine 5 is a \"long-term project\" for the team, and that more details will be shared when they have something to show. So, don't expect this upgrade to launch this year.

Here is our release trailer for the game:\n\n[previewyoutube=XcOnFLxfau8;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n\n[h2]All You Need To Know[/h2]\nAlso, if you'd like to learn more about the game, here's a short video that talks about all the important details and should answer the most common questions you might have:  \n\n[previewyoutube=KDBKSxV5mTk;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h1] Thank you for your support![/h1]\n\nWe'd like to remind you, that our studio is composed of just [b]5 people[/b], so all the feedback and help we keep receiving from our community is appreciated!

Rather than destroying these items when an area is unloaded they are now recycled (pooled) and reused in the next loaded area. Many changes and optimizations were made to the code for each barricade type (e.g., generators, mannequins, signs) in order to take advantage of this performance improvement, so there will probably be some unusual bugs to track down.\n\nModded barricades/structures with custom logic may need editing before they become compatible with pooling. To work around this, pooling can be disabled per-item by adding the line \"Eligible_For_Pooling false\" to their .dat file.\n\n[url=https://blog.smartlydressedgames.com/unturned-in-2021/]Read about the motivations and priorities behind this rewrite here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Patch #1:[/h1]\n\n[b]Fixed:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Claim flags not changing owner properly.\n[/list]",

For example, lying that a discount is nearly expired, or pretending the price is discounted when it has never been at full price. We would strongly advise following Steam's discounting rules to help avoid breaking any real-world laws.\"\n\nUnlike the previous rules there was no prolonged advanced warning period because this seems like an obvious rule that should not have needed explicitly stating.",

Among that group is Eli, a nerdy planner with an MBA, Neenah, who provides the driving talent and Kevin, who, er, has some lovely abs? Then there's the player character themselves, defined by the player using some of the same deep customisation options seen previously in the series - and the group's make-up promises to play into the co-op that is also at the heart of this Saints Row reboot. </p><p>Providing the playground this time out is Santo Ileso, which draws heavily upon the American south west. It's broken down into nine distinct districts, including the downbeat Rancho Providencio, Las Vegas analogue El Dorado and the secluded suburban Monte Vista.

There's another pair of games this week, including the hyper-violent top-down action game, God's Trigger. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/enter-the-gungeon\">Enter the Gungeon</a> also returns from last year's Epic giveaways for a slightly more family-friendly alternative.</p>\n<p>Both God's Trigger and Enter the Gungeon go live through the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/free-games\">promo page</a> on August 20 at 8:00 PDT / 11:00 EDT / 16:00 BST, right when <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/remnant-from-the-ashes\">Remnant: From the Ashes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/remnant-from-the-ashes/free-epic-games\">The Alto Collection</a> are removed from the rotation. As always, you'll 'purchase' the games at price of nothing, and they will remain in your Epic library forever.</p>\n<p>God's Trigger has some Hotline Miami vibes, though with a little more comic book in the aesthetic and a little less LSD. It's a top-down action game where you inflict gruesome violence on enemies with a variety of weapons in ultra-fast-paced battles. Here, however, you can also do it in co-op.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/enter-the-gungeon/free-games-epic\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/free-games-twitch-prime-january-2020\">Twitch Prime giving away ten free games right now - but many end today, so be quick!</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/enter-the-gungeon/enter-the-gungeon-advanced-gungeons-draguns-free-update\">Enter the Gungeon set for a massive, free update Thursday</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/anime-shoot-em-up-malware\">Anime shoot-'em-up malware holds your files at ransom until you can beat the high score</a></p>\n",

The Gungeon has become a paradox and is collapsing! Armed with an ever-changing weapon, an insatiable need to loot, and the trusty dodge roll, each of our heroes must ascend and escape via their own unique route of increasingly perilous elevators. Battle against the last and most bitter of the Gundead at a frantic pace, slowing down just long enough to chat with some familiar faces… and a few new ones. Shifting rooms, enemies, bosses, bizarre weapons and items all combine to ensure that no two attempts to Exit the Gungeon are the same.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8331399/0e40096d4d79d19b425a66e8ecbb519d51a177cc.png[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8331399/29967bc0cac3d03f8bf2d7ceea2f27c9d812ae83.png[/img]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/8331399/09ebdd000d19e95a139636f2e9fc0de838aae0f8.png[/img]",

If you haven't noticed, well, it's not too late to check!\n\nI considered pushing through the updates and just seeing what people would say as some chaotic fun, but then I figured it was best to let you all know so as not to alarm anyone. So now you know!\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is still the same game you know and love; we just had some cool new assets from our [url=https://merch.braceyourselfgames.com/collections/frontpage/products/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-physical-standard-edition/?utm_source=news?utm_medium=steam?utm_campaign=libraryupdatemay32021]physical edition[/url] and [url=https://merch.braceyourselfgames.com/collections/frontpage/products/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-physical-collector-s-edition/?utm_source=news?utm_medium=steam?utm_campaign=libraryupdatemay32021]collector's edition[/url] releases that we wanted to use.

Constantin Film acquired the rights from Avalanche Studios and Square Enix and is apparently hoping it will just be the start of a series. There&apos;s always another island full of stuff to blow up.&#xA0;</p><p>I doubt there&apos;s going to be much need to tweak things to get Just Cause to fit the action movie mould. According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/05/just-cause-videogame-movie-john-wick-creator-derek-kolstad-writing-constantin-film-1202619886/\" target=\"_blank\">Deadline</a>, it sees Rico Rodriguez once again trying to stop the Black Hand, a mercenary group that&apos;s shown up in three of the four games. And like the games, expect him to use his grappling hook, wingsuit and penchant for causing mayhem to help him take down the mercenaries.&#xA0;</p><p>The last game was full of spectacle and weaponised weather, but the series is starting to feel a bit creaky. Check out Robert Zak&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/just-cause-4-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Just Cause 4 review</a>. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Just Cause 4 still taps into that need for reckless abandon that resides in all gamers, but its impact is softening,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I have a good several hours of tethering tomfoolery left in me, but once I put it down, I can&apos;t see myself returning to this series until it gets the refurbishment it deserves.&quot;</p><p>It&apos;s the weakest of the series, so this probably isn&apos;t the most auspicious time for a movie, but with Derek Kolstad involved there&apos;s maybe a chance it could be watchable. The John Wick trilogy is the best thing to happen to modern action movies, and it&apos;s getting an adaptation, too, in the form of turn-based tactics game <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/a-turn-based-john-wick-game-is-coming/\" target=\"_blank\">John Wick Hex</a>.</p><p><br></p>",

Today, Phil's blown away by JC2's best weapon.\n\t</p>\n</div><p>\n\tI&nbsp;was disappointed with Just Cause 3 for many of the same reasons that Andy outlined our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/just-cause-3-review/\">67% review</a>. It   s an incredibly repetitive, grindy experience that turns chaotic action into a chore. Overthrowing evil dictators should only feel like a job if it   s your actual job. But worse than the failings of JC3   s progression systems is how unimaginative its tools are.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tThere are a few exceptions. There   s the wingsuit, which is brilliant. There are the tethers, which are ridiculous. There   s the opportunity to upgrade your infinite C4 into a rocket-powered physics toy, which is an idea of unparalleled genius. Elsewhere, though, it   s all pretty standard. In the context of an absurd action sandbox, the game   s many assault rifles feel painfully dull. Putting a stream of bullets into endless waves of people wasn   t fun to watch in Rambo IV, and it isn   t much fun to do here.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tFortunately, I don   t think JC3 is beyond saving. All you need to do is look at its predecessor. Much like its sequel, Just Cause 2 is surprisingly short on ways to push against the outer limits of creativity. The tools that do exist are even more basic and restrictive. You have a single, weak tether, and a finite amount of regular, non-rocket-powered C4. Its structure is more suited to improvisational violence, but you have only a limited set of options with which to create it. Two things expand that sandbox in delightful ways: mods and DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tIt feels strange to praise Just Cause 2   s DLC, because much of it isn   t noteworthy. Rather than large content packs, all of the game   s optional extras are small, seemingly insignificant microtransactions. Much of them are pure filler, but one small addition&mdash;available as part of the preposterously named Black Market Boom Pack&mdash;changed how I interacted with that world.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tIt   s called the Air Propulsion Gun, and, as the name suggest, it shoots air instead of bullets. It   s a high-powered short-range burst of force that results in some of the best physics-based mayhem since Half-Life 2   s Gravity Gun. It   s not quite on a par&mdash;Rico still doesn   t have much small-scale agency beyond making things explode&mdash;but sending a soldier spiralling into the air with a propulsion blast is funny in a way that doesn   t get old.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>\n\t\tIt provides the best physics-based mayhem since Half-Life 2   s Gravity Gun.\n</blockquote><p>\n\tThe problem with guns and explosions is they remove things from play. An enemy helicopter is an interesting problem to tackle, but shooting it down simply takes it out of the equation. That   s why the more interesting option is to grapple up and hijack it. The problem has been flipped into a solution, thus forcing the enemy to respond.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tThat   s also the genius of the air propulsion gun. It doesn   t remove things outright. A soldier is sent flying backwards, but the impact won   t necessarily kill him. A vehicle can be flung into a group of soldiers, possibly exploding, but maybe not. It   s a weapon in form and function, but one that doesn   t do direct damage. By shifting the kill to the moment of impact, you   re no longer instantly removing the threat. Even if your enemy only exists for a few extra seconds, those lengthened interactions feel more dynamic, surprising and enjoyable.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tIt   s even better when combined with the community   s BOLOPatch trainer&mdash;a tool offering invincibility, and infinite ammo and unbreakable tethers. Avalanche has never quite perfected the balance of the Just Cause series, and so I   ve always found it better to forego the difficulty for pure, unrestrained action. Military&nbsp;bases are cleared through a constant stream of powerful propulsion. Tens of soldiers dance and flip helplessly through the air in a mass juggling act performed by a petty, unkillable god. It   s one of the silliest power fantasies you can play.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tI   d hoped Just Cause 3 would build on this amazing DLC gun. So much effort has gone into improving its physics and effects but there   s precious little that makes use of such enhancements. Like Just Cause 2, the majority of JC3   s weapons are designed simply to remove aspects of play. I find it really frustrating that the game can be so creative in some aspects, and so tediously restrained in so many others.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\tMy hope is, just like with JC2, Avalanche is saving its best tools for DLC. If that   s the case, it   s a shitty business model, but I   d still happily pay a few extra pounds for weapons that manipulated the world in more interesting ways. Just Cause 3 falls short of its reputation as a cartoonish action playground. With some more imaginative weapons, it would be instantly, immeasurably more fun.</p>\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Changing that would be like making football games shorter - so why does the debate surrounding the game's supposedly overindulgent length resurface every year?</p>\n<p>Solving this issue could be as simple as switching back to a max rounds 12 (MR12) system used in early CS 1.5-6 and repopularised by Riot Games' Valorant - but with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive it might not be that simple. Unlike other esports game where balance adjustments are commonplace, CS:GO is sensitive to change: it is, after all, a formula that has largely stayed the same for 20 years now.</p>\n<p>However, the competitive scene is at a crossroads, with the most recent return to LAN at IEM Cologne 2021 reigniting conversations surrounding the length of games. Valorant has offered the first real challenge in a long time to CS:GO's title as the top tier FPS esport, and it will be up to Valve (and even the tournament organisers) to decide whether the length of the games are a necessary sacrifice to stay at the top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/long-games-mr15\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/patch-notes\">CS:GO patch notes: what's new in the latest update?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/stockholm-major-host-update\">PGL \"still hopes\" to host CS:GO Major in Sweden, confirms two backup hosts</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/csgo/iem-katowice-heroic-covid-test\">Heroic CS:GO player tests positive for COVID-19 at IEM Cologne 2021</a></p>",

                                "contents": "General fixes:\n-Vengeful Spirit deals a lot more contact damage, before it was dealing much less than intended\n-hostile enemies spawned glitch items no longer deal instant damage, so the player gets a small amount of time to get away from them\n- Fixed Vanishing Twin being able to turn into Dark Esau\n- Fixed Locust of War + Brimstone Bombs being able to damage the player when spawned by Cricket Leg\n- Fixed a bug which caused the first two floors of the alternate path to always share the same variant, making it impossible to see both Downpour and Dross in the same run\n\nGeneral modding changes:\n- Mods are now stored in a \"mods\" folder in the same directory as the rest of the game files\n\t- This directory can be easily accessed by right clicking The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth in the Steam library, then clicking on \"Properties\", \"Local Files\", and finally \"Browse...\"\n- Mod save data is now stored separately in a \"data\" folder, meaning that updating or unsubscribing from a mod will no longer cause its save data to be wiped\n\t- The name of the subfolder used to store save data is determined by the \"directory\" property in metadata.xml\n- Added a loading screen that appears when installing or updating mods from Steam Workshop\n\nXML changes:\n- Players (players.xml)\n\t- Added the following properties:\n\t\t- broken: Number of broken hearts this player begins with\n\t\t- pocketActive: Gives this player the specified starting active item in the pocket item slot\n\t\t- birthright: The unique description that should be displayed when this character picks up Birthright\n\t\t- bSkinParent: If present, marks this character as the \"tainted\" version of the regular character that bears the specified name\n\t\t\t- Usually, this should be set to the same name as the character, unless the tainted and regular version of this character bear different names\n\t\t\t- If there is no regular character to attach to, this character will not be available in the character selection menu\n\t\t- hidden: If set to \"true\", hides this character from the character selection menu\n\t- Custom coop selection graphics can be set for all modded characters by supplying the following animation file (non-tainted characters only):\n\t\t- \"content/Coop Menu.anm2\": Must contain one animation per character, each animation must bear the same name as the character it was made for\n\t- Custom menu graphics can be set for tainted characters by supplying the following animation files:\n\t\t- \"content/CharacterMenuAlt.anm2\"\n\t\t- \"content/CharacterPortraitsAlt.anm2\"\n\t\t- \"content/Death Screen Alt.anm2\"\n\t\t- \"content/Coop Menu Alt.anm2\"\n\t- \"content/CharacterMenu.anm2\" and \"content/CharacterMenuAlt.anm2\" no longer require a \"Background\" layer as the game now renders the paper background automatically\n- Items (items.xml)\n\t- Added the following properties:\n\t\t- shopprice: Sets a custom shop price for this item\n\t\t- initcharge: Overrides the initial charge for this item (this can be used for active items that do not start with a full charge)\n\t\t- chargetype: Can be set one of the following 3 values: normal (recharges on room clear), timed (recharges over time), special (never recharges automatically, cannot be recharged by batteries or item effects)\n\t\t- passivecache: If set to true on an active item, evaluates the player's stats on pickup like a passive item rather than when using the item\n\t\t- hidden: If set to true, cannot be obtained in game unless explicitly spawned or given to the player\n\t\t- persistent: If set to true, temporary effects tied to this item persist between rooms\n\t\t- quality: Sets the quality of this item (0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest quality and 4 is the highest)\n\t\t- tags: Adds one or more tags to this item (see items_metadata.xml for reference)\n\t\t\nLua changes:\n- Added a new include() function which acts like a \"raw\" version of require() and will always load the specified file even if it was loaded before\n- Fixed the spelling of EntityPlayer:GetMaxPocketItems() and EntityPlayer:DropPocketItem()\n\t* Previous spellings are still present for backwards compatibility but should no longer be used\n- Sprite:SetFrame() can now be called with only an int argument, this will adjust the current frame for the current animation without stopping it\n- Vector multiplication is now commutative (number * vector is a valid operation) and supports element-wise vector by vector multiplication\n- Color(R, G, B, A, RO, GO, BO) has been updated:\n\t- Only the first three arguments (R, G, B) are required, A defaults to 1 when omitted\n\t- The offset parameters (RO, GO, BO) default to 0 when omitted and are now in the 0-1 range instead of 0-255 for consistency\n\t\t- Mods that use this feature will need to be updated\n- Added constants Vector.Zero, Vector.One and Color.Default for convenience purposes\n- Updated Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName(string Name, boolean Tainted = false)\n\t- If Tainted is omitted or set to false, only matches non-tainted characters\n\t- If Tainted is set to true, only matches tainted characters\n- Tear flags are now represented by the BitSet128 data type, this was a necessary change due 64 bits no longer being enough to hold every tear effect in the game\n\t- Most AB+ mods should be backwards compatible, however due to a limitation from Lua, expressions such as \"Tear.TearFlags & TearFlags.TEAR_POISON == 0\" no longer work correctly\n\t- This can be quickly fixed by either replacing \"==\" with \"<=\", replacing 0 with TearFlags.TEAR_NORMAL, or using the convenience functions below\n\t- The following convenience functions have been added:\n\t\t- void Entity_Tear:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Tear:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Tear:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Bomb:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Bomb:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Bomb:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Laser:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Laser:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Laser:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Knife:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Knife:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Knife:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n- Updated EntityProjectile:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- void ClearProjectileFlags(int Flags)\n\t\t- boolean HasProjectileFlags(int Flags)\n- MC_PRE_SPAWN_CLEAN_AWARD, MC_PRE_NPC_UPDATE and all MC_PRE_xxx_COLLISION callbacks will now only skip remaining callbacks when returning a non-nil value\n- MC_GET_SHADER_PARAMS will now only skip remaining callbacks when returning a table\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_CARD (int CardId, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_PILL (int PillId, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_PRE_USE_ITEM (int ItemId, RNG ItemRng, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags, int ActiveSlot, int CustomVarData)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_ITEM (int ItemId, RNG ItemRng, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags, int ActiveSlot, int CustomVarData)\n\t- If a table is returned instead of a boolean, the following fields can be set to a non-nil value for extra functionality:\n\t\t- Discharge: Determines whether the item should be discharged or not after being used\n\t\t- Remove: Determines whether the item should be removed from the player or not after being used\n\t\t- ShowAnim: Plays the default use animation if set to true (equivalent to simply returning true in AB+)\n- Updated PlayerTypes.ActiveItemDesc\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- int TimedRechargeCooldown: Number of frames before an item with a timed cooldown can recharge again (used by Spin To Win to pause its recharge after fully discharging it)\n\t\t- float PartialCharge: How close the item is to gaining another charge (0-1 range, used by 4.5 Volt)\n\t\t- int VarData: Holds extra information for some active items (such as the number of uses for Jar of Wisps)\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- boolean Lock\n- Updated EntityPickup:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- int OptionsPickupIndex: Any non-zero value causes the item to form an option group with any other item with the same OptionsPickupIndex value.\n\t\t\tWhen an item belonging to an option group is picked up, all other items belonging to the same group disappear.\n\t\t\t0 is the default value and means the item doesn't belong to any group.\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- boolean TheresOptionsPickup: see above\n- Updated GridEntity:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- RNG GetRNG()\n\t\t\t* The object returned from this function is now a reference rather than a copy\n\t\t- Sprite GetSprite()\n\t\t\t* Same as above\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- RNG RNG\n\t\t- Sprite Sprite\n- Updated Sprite:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- string GetAnimation()\n\t\t- string GetOverlayAnimation()\n- Updated EntityPlayer:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- void ChangePlayerType(PlayerType Type)\n\t\t- void AddBrokenHearts(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetBrokenHearts()\n\t\t- void AddRottenHearts(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetRottenHearts()\n\t\t- boolean CanPickRottenHearts()\n\t\t- void AddSoulCharge(int Num)\n\t\t- void SetSoulCharge(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetSoulCharge()\n\t\t- int GetEffectiveSoulCharge()\n\t\t- void AddBloodCharge(int Num)\n\t\t- void SetBloodCharge(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetBloodCharge()\n\t\t- int GetEffectiveBloodCharge()\n\t\t- EntityPlayer GetMainTwin()\n\t\t- EntityPlayer GetOtherTwin()\n\t\t- boolean TryHoldEntity(Entity Ent)\n\t\t- Entity ThrowHeldEntity(Vector Velocity)\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar AddFriendlyDip(int Subtype, Vector Position)\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar ThrowFriendlyDip(int Subtype, Vector Position, Vector Target = Vector.Zero)\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar AddWisp(int Subtype, Vector Position, boolean AdjustOrbitLayer = false, boolean DontUpdate = false)\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar AddItemWisp(int Subtype, Vector Position, boolean AdjustOrbitLayer = false)\n\t\t- void TriggerBookOfVirtues(CollectibleType Type = CollectibleType.COLLECTIBLE_NULL)\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar AddSwarmFlyOrbital(Vector Position)\n\t\t- int GetNumGigaBombs()\n\t\t- void AddGigaBombs(int Num)\n\t\t- CollectibleType GetModelingClayEffect()\n\t\t- void AddCurseMistEffect()\n\t\t- void RemoveCurseMistEffect()\n\t\t- boolean HasCurseMistEffect()\n\t\t- boolean IsCoopGhost()\n\t\t- EntityFamiliar AddMinisaac(Vector Position, boolean PlayAnim = true)\n\t\t- void SetPocketActiveItem(CollectibleType Type, ActiveSlot Slot =

will adjust the current frame for the current animation without stopping it\n- Vector multiplication is now commutative (number * vector is a valid operation) and supports element-wise vector by vector multiplication\n- Color(R, G, B, A, RO, GO, BO) has been updated:\n\t- Only the first three arguments (R, G, B) are required, A defaults to 1 when omitted\n\t- The offset parameters (RO, GO, BO) default to 0 when omitted and are now in the 0-1 range instead of 0-255 for consistency\n\t\t- Mods that use this feature will need to be updated\n- Added constants Vector.Zero, Vector.One and Color.Default for convenience purposes\n- Updated Isaac.GetPlayerTypeByName(string Name, boolean Tainted = false)\n\t- If Tainted is omitted or set to false, only matches non-tainted characters\n\t- If Tainted is set to true, only matches tainted characters\n- Tear flags are now represented by the BitSet128 data type, this was a necessary change due 64 bits no longer being enough to hold every tear effect in the game\n\t- Most AB+ mods should be backwards compatible, however due to a limitation from Lua, expressions such as \"Tear.TearFlags & TearFlags.TEAR_POISON == 0\" no longer work correctly\n\t- This can be quickly fixed by either replacing \"==\" with \"<=\", replacing 0 with TearFlags.TEAR_NORMAL, or using the convenience functions below\n\t- The following convenience functions have been added:\n\t\t- void Entity_Tear:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Tear:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Tear:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t-

Entity_Laser:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Laser:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Laser:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Knife:AddTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- void Entity_Knife:ClearTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n\t\t- boolean Entity_Knife:HasTearFlags(BitSet128 Flags)\n- Updated EntityProjectile:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- void ClearProjectileFlags(int Flags)\n\t\t- boolean HasProjectileFlags(int Flags)\n- MC_PRE_SPAWN_CLEAN_AWARD, MC_PRE_NPC_UPDATE and all MC_PRE_xxx_COLLISION callbacks will now only skip remaining callbacks when returning a non-nil value\n- MC_GET_SHADER_PARAMS will now only skip remaining callbacks when returning a table\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_CARD (int CardId, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_PILL (int PillId, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_PRE_USE_ITEM (int ItemId, RNG ItemRng, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags, int ActiveSlot, int CustomVarData)\n- Updated arguments passed to MC_USE_ITEM (int ItemId, RNG ItemRng, EntityPlayer Player, int UseFlags, int ActiveSlot, int CustomVarData)\n\t- If a table is returned instead of a boolean, the following fields can be set to a non-nil value for extra functionality:\n\t\t- Discharge: Determines whether the item should be discharged or not after being used\n\t\t- Remove: Determines whether the item should be removed from the player or not after being used\n\t\t- ShowAnim: Plays the default use animation if set to true (equivalent to simply returning true in AB+)\n- Updated PlayerTypes.ActiveItemDesc\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- int TimedRechargeCooldown: Number of frames before an item with a timed cooldown can recharge again (used by Spin To Win to pause its recharge after fully discharging it)\n\t\t- float PartialCharge: How close the item is to gaining another charge (0-1 range, used by 4.5 Volt)\n\t\t- int VarData: Holds extra information for some active items (such as the number of uses for Jar of Wisps)\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- boolean Lock\n- Updated EntityPickup:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- int OptionsPickupIndex: Any non-zero value causes the item to form an option group with any other item with the same OptionsPickupIndex value.\n\t\t\tWhen an item belonging to an option group is picked up, all other items belonging to the same group disappear.\n\t\t\t0 is the default value and means the item doesn't belong to any group.\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- boolean TheresOptionsPickup: see above\n- Updated GridEntity:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- RNG GetRNG()\n\t\t\t* The object returned from this function is now a reference rather than a copy\n\t\t- Sprite GetSprite()\n\t\t\t* Same as above\n\t- Removed:\n\t\t- RNG RNG\n\t\t- Sprite Sprite\n- Updated Sprite:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- string GetAnimation()\n\t\t- string GetOverlayAnimation()\n- Updated EntityPlayer:\n\t- Added:\n\t\t- void ChangePlayerType(PlayerType Type)\n\t\t- void AddBrokenHearts(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetBrokenHearts()\n\t\t- void AddRottenHearts(int Num)\n\t\t- int GetRottenHearts()\n\t\t- boolean

Multiple films, in fact. Reports suggest that both Netflix and MGM are developing <a href=\"https://www.thedigitalfix.com/movies\">movies</a> based on the short squeeze. Whether either of these movies will come out before we either forget about the GameStop talk or begin to endure a total financial apocalypse remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>MGM has picked up the rights to a book proposal called The Antisocial Network from author Ben Mezrich, as <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/01/mgm-ben-mezrichs-the-antisocial-network-wall-street-1234684378/\">Deadline</a> reports. Mezrich also authored The Accidental Billionaires, which was adapted into The Social Network. Michael DeLuca produced The Social Network, and is now chairman of MGM's motion pictures group - Deadline says the new film is \"a priority\" for DeLuca.</p>\n<p>Netflix is separately developing an original film on the GameStop stocks, as <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/02/netflix-gamestop-stock-movie-screenwriter-mark-boal-noah-centineo-scott-galloway-makeready-1234684568/\">Deadline later reported</a>.

There are some interesting connotations that come along with clicker games. Also known as 'idle' or 'incremental' games, the name betrays certain expectations: click your mouse, get a tiny reward, and repeat until you can make the process more efficient and lucrative.</p>\n<p>In most cases, there's a snowball effect that accompanies your progress that makes your clicks more productive, hence the \"incremental\" moniker. There are also many games that operate automatically even when you're not playing, which justifies the \"idle\" nickname.</p>\n<p>Clicker games manage to distil high-complexity concepts down into a series of single clicks and automation. It's an interesting concept that is ripe for study, and really makes you think about what makes a game, a game. The entire concept of idle games is a fascinating experiment in how to squeeze the most game out of a single click of the mouse. In doing so these incremental games manage to make sprawling role-playing games digestible for those who can only spare a few minutes each day for gaming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-idle-games-clicker-games-pc\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>",

Additionally, check out the patch notes for both [i]Waking Flame[/i] and Update 31 on our [url=https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/categories/patch-notes]official forums[/url].\n\n[h2]Waking Flame DLC Game Pack[/h2]\nUncover evils in [i]The Elder Scrolls Online: Waking Flame[/i] with two amazing new dungeons: Red Petal Bastion and the Dread Cellar. While both PvE challenges explore unique stand-alone stories, they also expand upon the year-long Gates of Oblivion adventure and set up the events of the upcoming [i]Deadlands[/i] DLC (arriving later in 2021). \n\n[b]Red Petal Bastion[/b]\n\nFor centuries, the noble Knights of the Silver Rose had protected the people from Tamriel from the forces of Oblivion, but recently, the order has begun indiscriminately looting nearby shrines to collect holy relics, which they add to their fortress, the Red Petal Bastion. \n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/6349516/db38f8e1d9374c0f9a5386bc74f11118f4a8a3d2.jpg[/img]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t        \nA devotee of Azura needs your help to confront this once-noble order, reclaim his stolen artifacts, and discover the secret behind the order’s sudden and violent turn. \n\n[b]The Dread Cellar[/b]\n\nWhispered to be one of the Empire’s most-feared prisons, the Dread Cellar, long thought abandoned, has begun emanating mysterious magical energies. Now home to the cultists of the Waking Flame and their Daedric minions, this once-feared site holds new evils for any would-be adventurers.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/6349516/6de42719eff5d82a8de5b3d3b161933b01403ef5.jpg[/img]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t        \nA pair of Imperial Battlemages needs your assistance in their investigation of the prison’s activity, but what role does the Dread Cellar’s own past have in the cultists’ fiendish plans? And to what lengths might the Battlespire go to protect the Empire’s secrets? \n\nBoth dungeons are filled with a host of challenging boss battles to overcome and mysteries to uncover, and both are available in Normal, Veteran, and Hard Mode difficulties for groups seeking difficult opposition.

The latter's all about a bunch of tomb raiders called the Knights of the Silver Rose, who once protected Tamriel from Daedric threats but have since strayed from their righteous path. They've been pillaging the precious relics of nearby temples and piling them high in the bowels of their stronghold. The problem is, those artefacts have been seeping some Daedric nastiness into the place, and the warriors of Red Petal Bastion have become consumed with corruption. Well, it happens.</p>\n<p>It's this band of glorified treasure hoarders that I got to battle in a demo session with lead encounter designer Mike Finnigan, creative director Rich Lambert, and dungeon team product owner Shane Slama ahead of the DLC's launch. But one heck of a surprise lay in wait: a boss so imbued with Daedric mischief he turned my crew and I into sweet roll-scarfing goats.</p>\n<p>The dungeon starts much as you'd expect. A wronged artefact owner wants his goodies back and the slightly scary Dremora 'Foolkiller' Lyranth will help, but only if she gets to keep one very specific relic. We battle early waves of enemies, like Silver Rose archers, warriors, and pyromancers, in the courtyards outside, one of whom is tormenting a poor doggo by hogging a roast chicken leg. So, in the words of Finnigan, she \"deserve[d] all the death for that\". Quite right. We pound her and her booty-burgling kind into the ground - y'know, for the oppressed mutts of Tamriel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/gates-of-oblivion-red-petal-bastion\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/dwemer\">Elder Scrolls Online wanted to explore the Dwemer, but Todd Howard said no</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/loot-crates\">Elder Scrolls Online won't require real money for loot crates any more</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/flames-of-ambition-black-drake-villa-bosses\">Elder Scrolls Online's new villa dungeon has some of the best bosses yet</a></p>",

You're not alone. Learning what to pick in the vehicle selection screen of a GTA Online race is difficult enough, especially if custom vehicles are enabled.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't have to be hard. We all know that one wrong selection can lead to a pretty rough race, so if you're clever enough to do your research to find out what the GTA Online fastest bike actually is, you're more likely to have more successful races.</p>\n<p>There's a lot to think about, though. While you might be tempted to opt for a bike based on its in-game stats or how quickly you think it can do 0-60mph, it's worth considering other factors, like handling and traction too. So with all of that in mind, here are the fastest bikes in GTA Online, based on their top speed, lap times, and price.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/grand-theft-auto-5/fastest-bike-gta-online\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/grand-theft-auto-5/gta-5-cheats\">GTA 5 Cheats: every cheat code for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/grand-theft-auto-5/fastest-car-gta-online\">GTA Online fastest car - every supercar you need to own</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/grand-theft-auto-5/car-meets\">GTA 5 car meets: everything you need to know about the new Los Santos Tuners event</a></p>",

Developer Team Cherry revealed that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight/hollow-knight-sales\">Hollow Knight had sold over one million copies on PC alone</a>, and that was all the way back in 2018.

Player counts have been steadily rising since June, it seems, with the previous peak of 11,893 players appearing on June 24. Prior to June, the highest player count fell on April 2020 at 11,508 - which at least corresponded with Hollow Knight's appearance in <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/humble-conquer-covid-19-bundle\">the big charity Humble Bundle to fight coronavirus</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight/player-count\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight/cheats\">I enjoyed Hollow Knight more when I cheated</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/humble-conquer-covid-19-bundle\">New Humble Bundle collects $1,000 of games and books to help fight coronavirus</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/humble-australia-fire-relief-bundle\">Hollow Knight and Void Bastards headline Humble's Australia Fire Relief bundle</a></p>",

The studio also says that \"The Bird That Drinks Tears is an amazing IP that features in-depth lore and an incredible new world,\" and that it \"see[s] immense value and untapped potential in the IP, and there is ample opportunity to expand that IP through a variety of mediums - not just games\". However, it still sounds like the multimedia project could still have appeal in a similar vein to The Witcher series based on what's been revealed so far.

Beyond this, nothing was known about what the studio was cooking up other than its codename 'Project Windless', but now it looks like Krafton's got a <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-fantasy-games-pc\">fantasy game</a> in the works that's reportedly like a \"Korean Witcher\".</p>\n<p>PUBG dataminer PlayerIGN has been reporting on a Krafton press conference held today - and in the South Korean language, it seems - on Twitter, and one of the topics that seems to have been covered is this fantasy novel-inspired IP.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/pubg-krafton-fantasy-game-the-witcher\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/henry-cavill-warhammer-geek\">Henry Cavill interrupts The Witcher chat to remind us he's a Warhammer geek too</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/complete-edition-netflix-free-dlc\">The Witcher 3's next-gen upgrade will include free DLC from the Netflix series</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/netflix-witcher-season-2-episodes\">Netflix reveals The Witcher's Season 2 episode titles alongside December release</a></p>",

The game will be a medieval-sci-fi mashup that looks set to appeal to Dark Souls and rat games fans alike.</p>\n<p>The Last Oricru is, like any great RPG game, about choices and consequences at its core. Set in a fantasy medieval realm, the game sees the player character awaken from a kind of cryogenic sleep to find themselves in a strange world full of tough, unforgiving, and skill-based combat - both in the form of duels and mass brawls against groups of NPCs. It has six skill trees which you invest in by collecting essences from fallen foes, and along the way you'll be making key decisions that affect the outcome of your tale. You can try to befriend them all in your playthrough - which probably won't work out so well, GoldKnights says - or you can make enemies with all, which could very well be possible. And tricky. Gulp.</p>\n<p>From the gameplay revealed, it looks like it's got something Dark Souls-esque about its combat and tone in some ways, although it's also got a distinctly sci-fi spin to it, too. It also has giant rat people, with giant rat tails and ears. You heard it here first, people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-last-oricru-announcement\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/80s-games\">FromSoftware's Neverending Story, and other dream '80s games</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-souls-3/soul-of-cinder-boss-fight-mod\">This Dark Souls 3 mod turns the final boss into \"an absolute chad\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-souls-3/mod-kairi-kingdom-hearts\">This Dark Souls 3 mod lets you play as Kairi from Kingdom Hearts 3</a></p>",

However, there's a lot more to the '80s than Harrison Ford-fronted <a href=\"https://www.thedigitalfix.com/best-action-movies\">action movies</a>.</p>\n<p>While we've already seen some of the biggest films of the leg warmer decade adapted into games, they're often pretty poor, and there's still a huge catalogue of '80s movies that haven't had their most sincere and heartwarming moments gutted and turned into game mechanics and progression loops.</p>\n<p>But for the game to come close to matching the acclaim and cult appeal of its filmic counterpart, it's <em>got</em> to be developed by the right studio. The Thing, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th all made a splash, but quickly disappeared from memory. All of this got us thinking: what if we devised a list of the best '80s films to turn into games, as well as the studios we want in charge of our definitely sensible adaptations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/80s-games\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-last-oricru-announcement\">The Last Oricru is an ARPG with Dark Souls-like boss fights and giant rat people</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-souls-3/soul-of-cinder-boss-fight-mod\">This Dark Souls 3 mod turns the final boss into \"an absolute chad\"</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-souls-3/mod-kairi-kingdom-hearts\">This Dark Souls 3 mod lets you play as Kairi from Kingdom Hearts 3</a></p>",

The aptly named Sim Settlements Team has posted a new trailer unveiling a \"DLC-sized expansion\" to the mod, which will feature Fallout 4's ruthless mercenary Gunners as a \"fleshed-out faction\" - and it's due to arrive sometime this autumn.</p>\n<p>Called 'Gunner Outbreak', the new mod expansion's trailer gives a good flavour of what's to come, introducing us to the kinds of people and places we can expect to see (embedded below for you to check out). We see the ominous arrival of Captain Wes and his crew of Gunners at a thriving settlement, with the fearsome leader declaring that it's now under his faction's control, with some threats dished out at its poor populace to keep them in line. Eek.</p>\n<p>While we only get a feel of the mod expansion's storyline in broad strokes in the clip, it looks like it'll see a group of rebels band together in the wake of the Gunners' arrival. There's brand-new - and impressive - voice acting featured, along with a bunch of other new content to dive into. The mod adds \"new disease mechanics, multiple large questlines, and a brand-new game mode where you establish your own faction headquarters\", the clip's description explains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/sim-settlements-2-gunner-outbreak\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/city-builder-spinoff\">What if: Fallout 4 had a city builder spinoff?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/mod-grab-attacks-finishers\">You can suplex dudes in Fallout 4 now</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/fallout-london-mod-covent-garden\">Fallout: London modders tease Covent Garden for the huge Fallout 4 mod</a></p>",

According to the press release about the new 2K-founded studio Cloud Chamber, <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-announced/\">wot is making a brand new BioShock</a>, it&#8217;s &#8220;iconic, first-person shooter gameplay&#8221;. Before <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/bioshock-infinite\">Binfinite</a> came out, original series lead Ken Levine said in an interview that it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sjUb1pn7o5w\">&#8220;incredibly detailed world&#8221;</a> each game lets you explore. Or maybe it&#8217;s the PoLiTiCs? BioShock, famously, includes a pretty basic critique of the wet fart that is Objectivism, causing people either to argue it was a searing work of political genius, or be furious that it <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a work of searing political genius. Perhaps it&#8217;s the settings? BioShock and <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/bioshock-2\">BioShock 2</a> were set in an underwater city, and Infinite was set in a floating one. I can only assume the new one will just be about a normal city. But <em>run on centrist principles</em>. The most dystopian system of them all!</p>\n<p>But of course, none of these things are really the hallmark of a BioShock game. What truly makes the series stand out is that you can shoot flying animals out of your hand, because of DNA. And I think we all know what that animal should be used as ammunition in the new BioShock. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/12/10/bioshock-4-should-let-you-fire-an-albatross-from-your-hand/#more-766579\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading BioShock 4 should let you fire an albatross from your hand\">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>\n",

The new BioShock is being made by Cloud Chamber, a new studio who&#8217;ll be working on the game &#8220;for the next several years.&#8221; Don&#8217;t hold your breath.

And what Lightyear Frontier is missing in galaxy-spanning scale, it makes up for with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/stardew-valley\">Stardew Valley</a>-style farming.</p>\n<p>Lightyear Frontier puts you on an alien planet with a mech suit you can use to tame the wilderness. You'll be able to cultivate crops and build a farm to protect your resources from weather effects and the ravages of the local wildlife - though it seems the creatures of this planet are herbivores, as they'll mostly be interested in eating your vegetables, not you.</p>\n<p>You can use the resources you harvest to upgrade your mech for further exploration on the planet. A host of alien ruins are around to discover, with an eons-old mystery there to drag you along for the ride - a ride you can enjoy in four-player co-op, as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/stardew-valley/lightyear-frontier\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/stardew-valley/game-pass\">Stardew Valley is coming to Game Pass</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/stardew-valley/emet-selch-ffxiv\">You can now marry FFXIV's Emet-Selch in Stardew Valley</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/stardew-valley/open-world-harvest-days\">Harvest Days is Stardew Valley, but open-world</a></p>",

The Golden Axe Doom mod is only at the pre-alpha stage, but it captures the feel of the original game perfectly.</p>\n<p>The game is being created by self-proclaimed Doom modder and retro FPS enthusiast <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBblazkowicz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@BBblazkowicz on Twitter</a>, who is creating Golden Axe Doom using the latest version of GZDoom. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBblazkowicz/status/1430309971036676098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pre-alpha build of the mod</a> is available now, which allows players to try out the first level of the game, 'Village Outskirts'.</p>\n<p>Since Golden Axe doesn't have any guns or long-range magic like in Amid Evil, combat is entirely melee-focused - and the mod adds a number of controls to make it fun to play, including the likes of jump-attacks, alternate-fire kicks, and even spinning attacks. Other than that it's a pretty authentic Golden Axe experience for fans of the original game, except in first-person - which actually makes the game a lot tougher.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom/golden-axe-mod\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom/mod-mortal-kombat-2\">This Doom mod lets you play Mortal Kombat 2</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom/playing-gif\">Doom is literally playing in this article</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/doom/gopro-controller\">Here's Doom on a GoPro drone controller</a></p>",

Way back in 1995, CivNet laid the foundations for multiplayer in Civilization, which remain mostly unchanged even to this day, while the original Command & Conquer came with two copies of the game to facilitate LAN play. These series have always let you form alliances, but what if they let you have multiple players controlling <em>the exact same team</em>.</p>\n<p>Just picture it: a married couple squabbling over childrens' claims in Crusader Kings 3; players controlling different states or regions within a single empire in Civilization; or splitting players into agricultural, construction, and military duties in Age of Empires. This kind of untethered, unguided co-op play would force players to constantly communicate and self-manage - a bit like Overcooked, but instead of juggling tomatoes and dirty dishes you're dealing with entire empires.</p>\n<p>The game that's recently introduced me to the joys - and indeed the frustrations - of same-team multiplayer is Rimworld, or more specifically Zetrith's multiplayer mod for it. The premise is simple: every player has equal control over the colony, and you just see the faded mouse cursors of other players moving around the screen. Crucially, there's nothing in the UI to indicate what other players are doing, which means you'll need to talk constantly to stay in sync and not tread on each other's toes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/civilization-vi/civ-6-same-team-co-op-strategy-game\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/civilization-vi/minecraft-wonder-builds\">A Civilization fan is using Minecraft to remake all of Civ 6's world wonders</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/civilization-vi/tier-list-friendly-leaders\">A Civilization 6 fan has ranked leaders based on how friendly they are</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-4X-games\">The best 4X games on PC</a></p>",

Today, Greene has posted a video explaining a bit about the studio's first project called Prologue—<a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknown-announces-prologue\">first teased back in 2019</a>. It will launch first as a tech demo about surviving in a procedurally generated wilderness, Greene says, and it'll also be \"a chance to look at what we've accomplished by leveraging machine learning\" for huge open worlds. Greene has explained more about Prologue today, with more information coming soon.\n</p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-next-game-prologue-is-an-open-world-survival-tech-demo\">Read more</a></p>",

This cute little minivan has space for four players, and is great at navigating its way through rugged terrain. But why do we love this humble Korean truck so much? It comes with a brand new feature that could turn the tide of your Taego matches.</p>\n<p>The Porter debuts a new Trunk System in PUBG, which allows squads to dump their weapons and loot in the back and cart it around the map. The Porter can hold any item that you can carry around in your own personal inventory, as well as weapons, vests, helmets, and backpacks, and any player can access it by walking next to it or getting inside it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/pubg/13-2-porter-truck\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/pubg/giveaway-codes\">We're giving away a PUBG Taego swag bag!</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/streamers/biggest-streamers\">Who are the biggest Twitch streamers?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/pubg/2-release-date\">PUBG 2 release date, rumours, platforms, and more</a></p>",

Some of us prefer a lighter, smaller notebook for life on-the-go, and sometimes that means giving up playing the most demanding PC games. Thankfully, in this age of bountiful indies and a huge classic library on Steam, there are still tons of fantastic PC games fit for our laptops. This is our collection of the best games for laptops and low-spec rigs—games that can give you hours of entertainment without stressing out your system. We've pulled from all sorts of genres, so there are some quick pick-up-and-play picks alongside RPGs that could keep you busy for weeks. There are games here you can replay for ages all by themselves, and ones that you could use to kill some time between meetings. These are mostly newer games with modest system requirements, but of course there are loads of classic PC games, from Doom to Half-Life 2, that will run buttery smooth on any modern laptop. Check out GOG's old games or the Internet Archive's in-browser emulation library. Looking for a new laptop to game on the go? Here's our guide to the best gaming laptops.  Slay the Spire Release date: 2019 | Developer: Mega Crit Games | Link: Steam An instantly addictive card combat roguelike, which takes the strategic fun of deckbuilding board games and marries it with the sensibilities of games like The Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain, where finding random \"relics\" can change how you play. Or, if you get a lucky combination, turn you into a murderous card god. Like the best roguelikes and deckbuilders, Slay the Spire feeds you that immense satisfaction when you find a combo that absolutely wrecks. Enemies that were once intimidating fall before you like flies. It's a fun one to replay again and again, thanks to unlockables like more powerful cards for each deck type, and protagonists that play wholly differently from one another. Into The Breach Release date: 2018 | Developer: Subset Games | Link: Humble Store A phenomenal, bite-sized turn-based strategy game from the makers of FTL, and easily one of PC Gamer's favorite games of 2018. It's incredibly replayable, with different mech squads and tactics to master. As we said in our review: \"Exacting, agonising, challenging, and intensely rewarding, Into the Breach delivers in the tiniest package the most perfectly formed tactics around.\" Untitled Goose Game Release date: 2019 | Developer: House House | Link: Official site The not titled goose game is plenty short and so are its required system specs. If you somehow went dark on the internet in the weeks following the Goose Game's launch, you may have missed how many goose memes it birthed into the unsuspecting mainstream social media sphere. The Goose Game is a charming little stealth puzzler about being a terribly foul goose on the loose in a quaint little British village. In our review, Luke Kemp says \"I can’t remember the last game that made me laugh so loudly and so often while I was playing it.\" Amid Evil Release: 2019 | Developer: Indefatigable | Link: Steam In the wake of 2016's Doom, we've seen a resurgence of new-but-old shooters that fully embrace the graphical styles and level design of 90s hallmarks like Quake and Hexen. Amid Evil may be the best of them: it's the heavy metal album cover version of a 90s FPS, full of epic axes, swords that shoot green energy beams, and grenade launcher wands that fire miniaturized planets as weapons. Every area in the game has a unique aesthetic and set of enemies, so it never overstays its welcome. And because the design is faithful to its 90s inspirations, it'll run on a toaster (a suitably hardcore toaster, anyway). If Amid Evil isn't quite your aesthetic, check out the also fantastic Dusk or Ion Fury. Magic: The Gathering Arena Release date: 2018 | Developer: Wizards of the Coast | Link: Official site Finally, the digital adaptation Magic deserves. The eternal collectible card game has gotten plenty of bite-size videogames over the years, and limped along with the bigger, messier Magic: The Gathering Online, but this one is finally the real Magic experience, and it's still a lot of fun. And its recommended system specs belong to 2011 hardware—any modern laptop will handle it no problem. \"It's free-to-play and generous,\" we wrote in our review. \"When you buy a booster pack, whether with cash or gold earned in-game, you earn wildcards which can be traded for any card of an equivalent rarity (replacing the typical dusting and crafting systems of other digital CCGs). It is much more generous than tabletop Magic. You'll still need to drop money for whatever perfect deck's dominating the meta, or if you can't be bothered grinding daily quests for gold. But if you climbed out of the money hole of collecting Magic cards in a book full of plastic sleeves back in the day, this is a safe way of re-experiencing that without going broke.\" Celeste Release date: 2018 | Developer: Matt Makes Games | Link: Steam The indie platformer darling of the past few years, and with good reason: Celeste combines tight, instantly satisfying controls with wonderful music and a story that may speak to you, if you've ever battled your way through depression. If you're more into the jumping than the self-reflection, that's okay too—Celeste has the snappiness of Super Meat Boy, where trying a challenge over and over again takes only seconds, and nailing it at the end leaves you pumping your fists. That air-dash. *Chef's kiss* Like many PC platformers, Celeste is perfectly playable with mouse and keyboard, but you might want to throw a controller with a good D-pad in your bag if you're traveling. Sunless Skies Release date: 2019 | Developer: Failbetter Games | Link: Steam Like Sunless Seas before it, Sunless Skies is part roguelike adventure, part interactive fiction. But it does both better than ever. It earned a 90 in our review, \"because of how brilliantly its disparate elements combine to produce exciting stories, from scrapes you survive by the skin of your teeth, to moments where your own hubris gets you killed. It helps that death means something, because that elevates the stakes when you’re one direct hit from a yawning hole opening up in your hull and some hideous monstrosity is circling around for another attack... Beyond the changes you make, the sheer range of scenarios and potential outcomes means you’ll discover something new on every run.\" For more wonderful writing in a game that leans more heavily towards interactive fiction with fewer survival mechanics, check out the sublime 80 Days, too. A game about traveling the world is perfect when you're traveling the world with a laptop. Opus Magnum Release date: 2017 | Developer: Zachtronics | Link: Steam We have only good things to say about Opus Magnum, but this endorsement could really be swapped out for any of Zachtronics' insidiously deep and clever puzzle games. If cyberpunk's your jam, try out Exapunks instead. But why Opus Magnum? The joy of expression that comes from building simple (or ridiculously complex) machines to solve a particular problem, then sitting back and watching it all work.  We scored it a 91, writing \"the magic to Opus Magnum is that while there are theoretical perfect machines, the space in which you construct your solution is so wide open that you feel like you’re piecing it all together entirely yourself, and the restrictions are entirely common sense, so frustrations are usually down to your own inability rather than arbitrary rules...  You’ll see how your Steam friends rated and a histogram showing where your ratings lie across all players; I challenge you not to feel tempted to go right back again to make your machine better, and to wonder, how on Earth was it possible to make it *that* quick?\" West of Loathing Release date: 2017 | Developer: Asymmetric | Link: Steam The funniest game of 2017, and maybe the funniest RPG we've ever played. This is a game you explore for jokes, not loot. They're in every corner of the world, and even in the options menu, and it's a joy to discover them. West of Loathing is also a genuinely fun and clever RPG, with classes like the Beanslinger and Cowpuncher instead of genre standards. As we wrote in our review: \"Flush a toilet for an XP gain, search a haystack for a needle or dig through a mine cart for a hunk of meat ore (West of Loathing has a meat-based economy), and insult yourself in a mirror to gain a combat buff because you angered yourself so much. Most importantly, sticking your nose in every corner of West of Loathing isn't just beneficial for improving your character's stats and filling your bottomless inventory with weapons, garments, food, hooch, and hats (there are over 50 of them!). This is a funny game, and you'll want to root out every last shred of humor before you're done with it.\" Baba Is You Release date: 2019 | Developer: Hempuli Oy | Link: Steam The best puzzle game of 2019? Certainly the one with the catchiest name. It's about pushing blocks, but also pushing words, which then become commands. And from those simple combinations, wild varieties of puzzles unfold. It's hard to describe but easy to understand once you play it, and in our review we dig into why it's so fun to play:  \"[One] solution is to make use of the blocks which determine your avatar—they read 'Baba is you' in a vertical line. Don’t disconnect them, otherwise 'you' no longer exist in the level and cannot interact with it. But you can use 'Baba' as the start of a horizontal command, a bit like a programming crossword puzzle. Write 'Baba is win' and it makes you (Baba) the win condition of the level. There’s so much potential and it’s so satisfying!\" Unavowed Release date: 2018 | Developer: Wadjet Eye | Link: Steam The latest adventure game from Blackwell creators Wadjet Eye is one of its best, bringing in demons, exorcisms, and some light roleplaying elements that affect how the story plays out. Take it from our review: \"Unavowed is another fantastic adventure from Wadjet Eye, and it’s great to see studio founder Dave Gilbert back in the saddle. The humour didn’t always land for me and some of the voice acting is a little iffy, but otherwise this is a fine example of a modern point-and-click adventure. The addition of character customisation and companions doesn’t sound like much, but it massively changes the feel of the game, even if other aspects, such as the puzzles, are still steeped in the past.\" Cuphead Release date: 2017 | Developer: StudioMDHR | Link: Humble Store Quite possibly the prettiest game you can play on a laptop or low-end system thanks to its hand-drawn, classically animated 2D graphics. Cuphead channels Gunstar Heroes and other 90s platformers with tough as nails multi-stage bosses, but learnable tells and patterns make it conquerable if you keep a cool head and stick with it. It's worth playing for the phenomenal soundtrack and art alone, but why not team up with Mugman and take down a few bosses while you're admiring the craft? Undertale Release date: 2015 | Developer: tobyfox | Link: Humble Store 2015's breakout RPG inversion might owe a bit of its widespread success to the fact that a toaster could run it. This isn't to say it's not a looker or fun. For those versed in RPG and popular video game tropes, Undertale is a colorful, charming, upsetting swan ride through your habits and behaviors. Date a skeleton, pet (or kill) some dogs, think way too hard about mice and cheese. Undertale will make you second guess every key press except the 'Buy' button. Darkest Dungeon Release date: 2016 | Developer: Red Hook Studios | Link: Humble Store A brilliant, stressful strategy dungeon explorer that channels Lovecraft with brilliant narration and truly terrifying quests. As your party encounters horrors in the dark, the stress piles on, and too much stress causes them to take on new personality quirks that snowball into yet more stress and loss of sanity. This creates a constant tension. What if your plague doctor is the most reliable member of your party, but insults his comrades every few minutes, raising their stress levels? Permadeath is brutal in Darkest Dungeon, but you'll find it hard to quit even when an entire party of heroes gets wiped out. Stardew Valley Release date: 2016 | Developer: ConcernedApe | Link: Humble Store An indie sensation that brought the idyllic farm life of Harvest Moon to PC. Build your farm into a vegetable empire, go exploring, learn about the lives of your neighbors, fall in love and settle down. Simple graphics ensure this one will run like a dream on your laptop, and it'll make long flights pass by in a snap. Gorogoa Release date: 2017 | Developer: Buried Signal | Link: Steam An ingenious puzzle game years in the making, hand-drawn by creator Jason Roberts. Gorogoa tells a story with its puzzles, rather than simply placing puzzles in a thematic wrapping. This is part of what makes it something special, and particularly engrossing, as we wrote in our review: \"The story itself is an interesting, ambiguous framework through which to explore the idea of repeating patterns. You aren’t quite seeing the underpinnings of the game’s universe so much as you’re tuning into refrains that recur across time and scale—coherence rather than transparency... A fantastic feat of interlocking storytelling and design.\" Heat Signature Release date: 2017 | Developer: Suspicious Developments | Link: Humble Store Made by former PC Gamer editor Tom Francis, creator of the also-excellent (and low-spec-friendly) Gunpoint, Heat Signature is a game about sneaking onto spaceships, braining guards with a wrench or using all kinds of gadgets to carry out a mission, and dealing with the chaos that ensues. In our review, we wrote: \"Heat Signature inspires creativity through emergent complexity like any great immersive sim. I can't stop regaling friends with my stories of heists gone bad or boasting about my flashes of brilliance in the heat of the moment. Heat Signature is brilliant at teasing these anecdotal threads out of a procedural universe.\" Torment: Tides of Numenera Release date: 2017 | Developer: inXile Entertainment | Link: Humble Store A successor to Planescape: Torment? It seemed too good to be true, and yet inXile took the engine Obsidian made for Pillars of Eternity and managed to return to the world of Torment in an RPG that recaptures much of what made the original so special. Lucky for laptop gamers, it can also run on low-end hardware, which is fitting for a throwback RPG. In our review, we wrote that \"a slow start gives way to a thought-provoking adventure in a remarkable setting. A fitting follow-up to a beloved RPG.\" Portal 2 Release date: 2011 | Developer: Valve | Link: Steam page We could have included pretty much any Source engine game here, such is the impressive way it scales to lower-spec hardware. (Admittedly, that might be because it's getting on a bit.) While Half-Life 2 shines these days with visual mods and at higher resolutions, Portal 2 remains one of the funniest, smartest puzzle games around, even if you had cause to play it at 800x600 with all the settings turned to 'Low'. You're not playing this one to be wowed by fancy graphical effects—you're playing for Stephen Merchant's, J.K. Simmons', and Ellen McLain's terrific voice acting, and of course for that bit with the potato. Minecraft Release date: 2011 | Developer: Mojang | Link: Official site One of the main questions you see asked online about laptops is “Will it run Minecraft?”, to which the answer, for future reference, is “Yeah probably”. Mojang's infinite block-'em-up isn't terribly demanding specs-wise, and it's the perfect game to mess around with on a laptop when you're supposed to be writing features for PC Gamer about low-spec games. While it's often played on a tablet, phone or console these days, you're getting the latest updates and mod support if you choose to build stuff with your PC. Here's our frequently updated list of the best Minecraft mods. Civilization 5 Release date: 2010 | Developer: Firaxis Games | Link: Humble Store Civ is usually a safe bet when it comes to low-end machines, and you won't need too beefy a PC in order to play the second newest entry in the series. Just don't go blaming us when you forget to sleep, so embroiled are you in your quest to wipe the warmongering Gandhi from the face of the Earth. 4Xs in general tend to be quite kind to laptops, so if you meet the (slightly less modest) requirements, it's worth casting your eye over Amplitude Studios' fantasy-themed Endless Legend, and Triumph's Age of Wonders III as well.",

Apologies for the delay, we have been reading [b][i]your feedback on \"Sleepy Hollow\"[/i][/b] and decided on delaying the update in order to improve that DLC. Here is a list of some of the changes in this update:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*] The \"Sleepy Hollow\" DLC has been updated with new items and puzzles!\r\n[*] Desktop player can now crouch using \"Ctrl\"\r\n[*] The timer and hints can be switched On or Off from the lobby, before the game starts.\r\n[*] After finishing a room, you can see how many hints you used and the time it took you to complete it in the lobby screen.\r\n[*] Menu sound options now saved between levels and game launches.\r\n[*] Minors changes on puzzles for clarification (i.e. an arrow on the toolbox in the Mine)\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThat's about it for now, as always we welcome all constructive feedback, please let us know your thoughts!\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n    OnSkull Games",

But what was once scarce then came in overwhelming abundance. The unbearable heat of the drought melted the glaciers of Valkenheim and as a result, the water levels rose dangerously. Torrential rains and violent winds fell upon Heathmoor, with no end to the storm in sight. With the home they once knew overrun with water, warriors found themselves out of their element. All except the Vikings, for whom the storm had brought about rebirth… and an opportunity to reign supreme.\n\nThe aforementioned themes are strongly represented in Y5S3 Tempest’s in-game realization and seasonal customization. For more information about the season, continue reading. We’ll go over the Storm Tides event, this season’s Battle Pass, everything regarding the Testing Grounds and more. Stay tuned for new armor variations and maybe some other surprises for Y5S3 TU2.\n\nLastly, for this season, we are excited to announce that, at launch, all heroes will be receiving a unique execution.\n\nFor detailed discussion of the season and what’s to come with the For Honor Dev Team, be sure to check out the Warrior’s Den VOD to see what’s to come on September 9th at launch Y5S3: Tempest. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptBRXQQ_paA&type=link]Y5S3 WD Reveal VOD[/url]\n\n[previewyoutube=eAzzZiseids;full][/previewyoutube]\n\n[h1]Storm Tides[/h1]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/666a4828591fb4c1be5b9f715dcdeb0410be1ec3.jpg[/img]\n\nAmid catastrophic flooding, Horkos and Chimera both struggled to survive. As safe land became a rare commodity, the animosity between warriors only intensified. Starting on season Launch until September 30th, players will be able to play through a Free Event Pass and gain access to a multitude of rewards such as a new Battle Outfit, an Effect as well as an Ornament. During the event there will also be new weapons available for players to loot.\n\n[h1]Battle Pass[/h1]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/e550afca9ccbcf1237fa6bfe1dba6785b019f821.jpg[/img]\n\nThe coming of unending rains led the Vikings to believe that Aegir and Ran, the deities of the sea, were listening. Legends said that the married couple ruled over the oceans, and that their generosity came from offerings. For Chimera, this meant honoring Ran by respecting nature. But Aegir demanded blood… and Horkos were more than happy to provide.\n\nThese themes make a strong impact in this season’s Battle Pass. It is now possible to dress your warriors with gear that will remind you of Norse divinity or to wear the jewels of the ocean.\n\nGear up for the storm with the Y5S3 Battle Pass. Get 100 tiers of rewards for all heroes to unlock new weapons and effects. Premium rewards include Tempest themed outfits, effects, weapons, a battle points boost from completed matches, 11K steel and more. This Y5S3 Battle Pass will be available from season launch to December 6th.\n\n[h1]Dominion Series[/h1]\n\nThe Stage 2 of the Dominion Series concluded on Saturday, Aug 28th. Participating teams in the NA and EU region were granted cash prizes and points that will count towards the Championship Finals in February. The VOD will be available on the [url=https://www.twitch.tv/forhonorgame]ForHonorGame Twitch channel [/url]and on Ubisoft’s YouTube channel.

It’s that time of the season again and we’re back with yet another Testing Grounds! They will be open from July 1st to July 8th.\n\nWe’re doing something a bit different this time – we’re trying both Hero changes as well as system-level changes in the form of Option Select changes.\n\nThe changes we’re covering in this Testing Grounds are:\n\n[list]\n[*]     Raider changes\n[*]     Orochi changes\n[*]     Shinobi changes\n[*]     Option Select improvements\n[/list]\n\nRaider’s changes are mostly about making the hero more consistent as well as more efficient. We’re improving the 1v1 potential of the hero while also making sure their Zone Attacks are better.\n\nOrochi’s changes aim to improve the performance in 1v1 situations as well as in group fights, where the hero is currently struggling.\n\nShinobi received quite large changes which should redefine how the hero plays. Shinobi should now be more focused on close-range combat and ganking, with the moveset centering around landing as many Sickle Rains as possible.\n\nFinally, we’re testing tech that should see the majority of Option Selects to be removed from the game entirely.\n\nKeep reading below for more details on the changes you can expect coming to Raider, Orochi, Shinobi, and Option Selects. You can also tune in to tomorrows Warrior’s Den where Stefan and myself will be going through all the changes.\n\nBefore getting to the Testing Grounds details, we would like to address some errors in the roadmap shown in our previous Warrior’s Den. Covenant Games should be starting a week earlier, right after Testing Grounds, on July 8th and ending on July 15th. Also, the Dominion Series Stage 2 Major will begin on August 28th. This is great news for participants as they will have one extra month to prepare.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/25307289/9e1dcda2765f2baa7ccbc3f1844129c1741e4010.jpg[/img]\n\n[h1]Raider Changes[/h1]\n\n[h2]Storming Tap[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now 400ms, down from 500ms\n[*]     Now no longer interrupted on non-Superior Block\n[*]     No longer has variable timing as a soft feint from Heavy Attacks\n[*]     Now deals different damage when using Soft Feint version and Dodge version\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Storming Tap had a few efficiency problems, most notably it was reactable by many players, even though it had variable timing. We’ve adjusted this so that it always comes out at the same timing as Feints, sped it up so it is more reliable, and made it not interrupted when blocked so that Raider can pressure opponents better.[/i]\n[h2]\nUninterruptible Stance Timings[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Adjusted Uninterruptible Stance during Heavy Attacks to always start at the feint timing instead of at various timings depending on the attack\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]This should still let Raider use Heavy Attacks to trade with opponents, but should no longer be at timings where players could take a hit, feint then guardbreak their opponents.[/i]\n\n[h2]Zone Attacks[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Raider’s Storm now costs 12 stamina, down from 50 stamina\n[*]     Raider’s Fury now costs 12 stamina, down from 35 stamina\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i] Raider uses Zone Attacks as alternate Heavy Attacks, both in mixups and in punishes. We’ve adjusted the Stamina cost of these attacks to cost the same as Heavy Attacks so that Raider can use them more often and more efficiently.[/i]\n\n[h2]Stampede Charge[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]  Now 500ms, down from 600ms\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment: [/b][/i] [i] Stampede Charge was too slow to be effectively used as a ganking tool. The slightly faster speed should make it easier to players to use it to plan out ganks.[/i]\n\n[h2]Top Lights in Chains[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]  Now 500ms (down from 600ms for 2nd and 700ms for finisher)\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]These attacks should now be in-line with other chained Light attacks[/i].\n\n[h2]Top Heavy Finisher[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now 900ms (down from 1000ms)\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]This should help Raider catch fleeing heroes better with a soft feint to Guardbreak than before. [/i]\n\n[h1]Orochi Changes[/h1]\n[h2]\nCancel Attack Recoveries into Dodge[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Can now cancel all non-Dodge attack (including Storm Rush) recoveries on Hit/non-Superior Block/Miss into Dodge\n[/list]\n[i][b]\nDeveloper’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Orochi needed a way to be more effective in outnumbered situations as well as being able to go on the offensive more efficiently. With this change Orochi should be able to perform both well, instead of relying on the Finisher’s recovery cancels only.[/i]\n\n[h2]Light Attacks[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Removed Light Finisher\n[*]     Every non-Bash Opener now guarantees a combo Light attack that counts as the 2nd hit in chains\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]We want to reorient Orochi into a powerful “One-Two” hero with multiple options when landing attacks so that players no longer need to rely on multiple fast light attacks and instead focus on mixups and agility. These changes should push Orochi towards this archetype.[/i]\n\n[h2]Storm Rush[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now accessible from Front Dodge as well as Back Dodge\n[*]     All 3 sides are now 600ms total with 400ms of visible indicators (changed from 500/600/700ms)\n[*]     All 3 sides are now Undodgeable\n[*]     Now costs 12 stamina to enter and 10 to feint. No other stamina costs.\n[*]     Was 10 to Enter, 12 to attack, 20 to feint\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Storm Rush’s role has expanded. While it can still be used as an opener, its main purpose is now as a mixup with his new Kick move where depending on the situation Orochi’s opponents must make a read as to block a Front Dodge Storm Rush, or dodge the Front Dodge Kick (see Front Dodge Kick below).[/i]\n\n[h2]Front Dodge Kick[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     NEW OPTION: Front Dodge Kick\n[*]     Performed by hitting Guard Break during Front Dodge\n[*]     500ms, can be performed at 300ms in Front Dodge and can be delayed until 500ms\n[*]     Gives a guaranteed 2nd non-Combo Light on hit\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i][i] Orochi did not have a Melee for the longest time, but this felt like the right time to improve on Orochi’s offense, considering the new direction we are pushing the hero towards. As Orochi moves from being a pure counter-attacker towards a more balanced 1v1 hero, this new option should give Orochi players more ways to open up opponents.[/i]\n\n[h2]Riptide Strike[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now 500ms, down from 600ms\n[*]     Now has iframes for 300ms (previously did not have any)\n[*]     No longer interrupted on non-Superior Block\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i][i] Riptide Strike, at this new speed and with the new iframes, makes it the optimal 1v1 counterattacking tool – it should be more reliable than before and deals slightly more damage than side Dodge Attacks.[/i]\n\n[h2]Side and Front Dodge Lights[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] No longer interrupted on non-Superior Block\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]With this new property, Orochi can effectively both target swap in fights and not be interrupted against attacks with fast recoveries.[/i]\n\n[h2]Side Heavy Finishers[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now have larger trajectories\n[*]     Now moves forward more\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Orochi had little incentive to use their Side Heavy Finishers; while they were faster than the Unblockable top version, these attacks did not allow for defense in outnumbered situations. With these new properties, we hope that Orochi is now able to move more swiftly in these types of situations and can deal with multiple opponents more efficiently.[/i]\n\n[h2]Deflect Attacks[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Removed Hurricane Blast (Heavy Followup)\n[*]     Wind Gust now forces a reaction on the opponent and guarantees a Combo Light attack\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment: [/b][/i] [i]Hurricane Blast was situational and was barely used – we opted to improve the functionality of Wind Gust instead so that it still provides a good satisfying attack while keeping some of the more advanced properties of Hurricane Blast.[/i]\n\n[h1]Shinobi[/h1]\n\n[h2]Ranged Attacks[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Removed Charging Heavy Attack from neutral\n[*]     Removed Ranged Guardbreak\n[*]     Ranged Heavy Attack is now a Melee and is only accessible after a Front Kick, Side Kick or Back Flip\n[*]     Ranged Heavy Attack can be target-swapped\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Shinobi’s use of ranged attacks was proving to be problematic. Players were able to use Ranged Guardbreak to gank opponents without indicators, and could use Ranged Heavy attacks to poke at opponents safely, from off-screen in group fight situations. Finally, other heroes just do not have the tools necessary to deal with these Ranged Guardbreaks – even if Shinobi ends up pulled to the ground, the opponent is still stuck in an animation in which they will certainly be hit by an external attacker. We want to change how Shinobi plays so that the hero is more of a very agile close-ranged hero rather than being relegated to running away from opponents and using ranged attacks, and ensuring that Shinobi’s tools work with respect to the opponents’ tools.[/i]\n\n[h2]Kicks[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Front Kick can now be performed after a single Front Dodge\n[*]     Side Kick can now be performed after a single Side Dodge\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Shinobi has difficulty accessing dodge attacks to counterattack and initiate against opponents. This change should help in making the hero more viable and better able to initiate offense.[/i]\n\n[h2]Chains[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Light Finishers now chain to Sickle Rain\n[*]     Combo Lights now chain to Sickle Rain\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Shinobi’s new offense revolves around landing Sickle Rain as much as possible – these changes should help in making the hero flow better towards their mixups.[/i]\n\n[h2]Sickle Rain[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Top Heavy Finisher is now Unblockable\n[*]     Top Heavy Finisher is now 800ms (up from 700ms)\n[*]     Side Heavy Finisher is now Undodgeable\n[*]     Additional hits for Sickle Rain no longer need strict timing\n[*]     Guardbreak now leads to Sickle Rain\n[/list]\n[i][b]\nDeveloper’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Sickle Rain is now the main focal point of Shinobi – as we move towards landing the attack more and more, making the Top version unblockable ensures that Shinobi has effective 1v1 mixups and can land the attack externally, while the side undodgeable versions are used in various mixups after a Front Roll to catch opponents who attempt to dodge the Flip Kick.[/i]\n\n[h2]Front Roll[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now chains to Flip Kick earlier\n[*]     Now chains to Sickle Rain\n[*]     Now accessible after a Back Flip\n[*]     Can be target-swapped after a Ranged Heavy attack or Back Flip\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i][i] Shinobi now has a definite use for Front Roll as a mixup tool after a Ranged Heavies and Back Flips – Flip Kick is now fully unreactable and players must read what option their opponent will do instead of blindly dodging every time they see Front Roll.[/i]\n\n[h2]Flip Kick[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now guarantees a Combo Heavy attack on hit\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Flip Kick is now also a chain extender, giving a free Heavy attack that chains to Sickle Rain when it lands.[/i]\n[h2]\nSprint Attack[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Replaced Sliding Kick with a new Sprint Attack\n[*]     New option is still a Bash but no longer unbalances opponents\n[*]     New option now also leads to Combo Heavy on hit\n[/list]\n[i][b]\nDeveloper’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]This new Sprint Attack is more in line with other fast Bash attacks from Sprint – the guaranteed damage on hit ensures that the move is still viable, but it should no longer be frustrating to play against, and allows us to remove the jankiness with the variable hit timing, and extended hit timings on a first hit.[/i]\n\n[h2]Combo Heavy Attack[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     NEW OPTION: Combo Heavy attack\n[*]     Accessible by pressing Heavy after a Flip Kick or a Sprint Attack\n[*]     Chains to Sickle Rain\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]This new option for Shinobi ensures that the hero flows better into Sickle Rain and gives proper damage on two of their bashes.[/i]\n\n[h2]Back Flip[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now only accessible on Hit only from any attack except Ranged Heavy\n[*]     Now chains to Front Roll\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i] Back Flip is able to give Shinobi distance quite easily – with this change, Shinobi has to work harder to get it.[/i]\n\n[h2]Deflect[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Teleport now needs to be activated using Guard Break input (no longer automatic)\n[*]     Now chains to Heavy Finisher\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment: [/b][/i][i] Shinobi was the only hero with a guaranteed, automatic Deflect. This change gives players more agency as to whether they want to use the attack or not, and now leads to mixups instead of guaranteeing damage against different heroes.[/i]\n\n[h2]Teleport Kick[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     No longer guaranteed after a Teleport\n[*]     Ranged Heavy attack followup is now always guaranteed\n[/list]\n\nDeveloper’s comment: [i]Shinobi was gaining a lot of damage after a successful Deflect – this change now shifts the balance towards mixups where the opponent has to read if Shinobi will perform a Kick or an undodgeable Side Sickle Rain.[/i]\n\n[h2]Shadow Strike[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]     Now chains to Teleport Kick\n[*]     Now chains to Sickle Rain\n[/list]\n\n[i][b]Developer’s comment:[/b][/i] [i]Shinobi now has access to strong mixups that lead to Sickle Rain when parrying, improving the hero’s flow.[/i]\n\nThe list of changes to Shinobi is quite exhaustive and may seem jarring to many players as the hero plays differently that before. We feel that this version allows much more variety in combat, is much more successful with mixups, and much healthier in the landscape of For Honor’s heroes’ toolsets. We look forward to your feedback on these changes!\n\n[h1]Option Selects - Testing Grounds[/h1]\n\nWe are introducing new tech in this Testing Grounds that lets us eliminate Parry Option Selects from the game. This ensures that offense is more potent, especially Unblockable offense, and has the potential to have large changes to the game’s meta at the skill levels where they are used.\n\nTo achieve this, we’ve ensured that when players enter inputs where one of the multiple outcomes is a Parry (outside of normal Parry attempts), said Parry is ignored and will not be performed. This means that when performing an Option Select, the non-Parry option will always occur. If you throw a Heavy Attack and feint it, your opponent will STILL perform the non-Parry option; if you let your attack go, however, the non-Parry option will get stuffed.\n\nIt is important to note that Zone Option Select, the most prevalent Option Select in the game (due to its ease of use) is also affected by this change. We are aware that some players advocate for keeping Zone Option Select in the game while removing the other, more egregious forms of Option Selects; in this case, our tech also disables Zone Option Select in general. We see this as a good thing as Zone Option Select effectively removes a layer of possible balancing we can use on Zone Attacks in general - when Zone Option Selects are present, Zone Attacks fall into 2 categories: Strong (because you can use them to Option Select) or Weak (because you can’t). This prevents us from using Stamina costs as a balancing lever on Zone Attacks. The removal of Zone Option Selects also lowers the efficiency of some specific Zone Attacks (Black Prior and Gladiator’s, more precisely) due to their state as a Bash, which made them especially strong as Option Selects as the typical counter (feint into Parry) cannot work against them.\n\nWe would also like to give a special shoutout and thanks to some members of our community who graciously helped us identify and reproduce a large variety of Option Selects. The Fight Team would like to specifically thank the following people with their involvement in this improvement:\n\n[list]\n[*]     Freeze\n[*]     The Filthy Spaniard\n[*]     Nutella\n[*]     Barak\n[*]     RavelordServant\n[*]     Skorbrand\n[*]     Setmyx\n[/list]\n\nTheir help has been invaluable in helping us pinpoint exactly what the problem was with our Option Selects and helped us properly reproduce them so that we could shut them down.\n\n[Stefan’s note: Huge thanks to these players for sharing their specialized knowledge of the game’s mechanics. This knowledge sharing here, and over the years has been critical to our ability to target the kinds of changes that we feel For Honor needs.\n\nQuick reminder: when you fill out your player survey or post on social media, remember that it is the dev team that chooses the exact solutions for these problems, so if you don’t like the solutions here in the Testing Grounds, remember that these players aren’t to blame! :D]\nClosing thoughts\n\nWe look forward to your feedback through the usual channels; we’ll monitor social media and will send a survey to formally gather your feedback.\n\nSee you on the battlefield!\n",

To put it simply, it's a trick that can be used to make you harder to shoot (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wiJVrUBhW4Y?t=306\">especially in the air</a>), whilst providing all the advantages of being mobile.

This dastardly agent of BRIGADE is here to help bring down The Company. This update also brings in the Monster Evolution track, dozens of improvements to animations and quality of life, deep space lore, and more. Time to activate.\n\n[h3]New Antagonist: The Traitor[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/47934f792731328c04a66d15795177f3103f62f2.png[/img]\nThe Traitor is now a role you can opt-in to at the start of a round, just like opting in as the Monster. The Traitor has one goal; help the Monster win. The They come complete with their own set of rules, and are largely identical to a Spaceman. Here's a few rules to get you started!\n[list]\n[*] There can be 1 Traitor in a round (but unlike the Monster, is not required.)\n[*] The Traitor can die and still win, as long as the Monster survives.\n[*] The Traitor can hack tons of objects (default keybinding \"N\") from long-distance with their B.R.I.C.K device. Don't let anyone see you do this! This can be as simple as remote-locking a door to sabotaging a vending machine so that Spacemen who use it get their arm stuck inside.\n[*] The Traitor (using Spacemen loadouts) has a new Perk slot with several new abilities, such as (but not limited to) Spacemen-snaring Man Traps, a return-teleport via a Translocator, or setting off the alarms on all the cameras in the facility.\n[*] Traitors start a bit weaker, at 90 Health (100 with Recruit perk.)\n[*] Traitors have not been infused with Company DNA and therefore can not pick up weapons provided by The Company via Vending Machines or Weapon Canisters. They can still pick up the Grenades, Suitcase Nukes, LMG, SMGs, and things of that nature. Things they can't pick up will pulse red, instead of the typical green.\n[*] The Traitor and the Shapeshifter can see one another when they look at each other.[/list][img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/d13c92bf8544a9759f1c5ece55c643707a9dc2bc.gif[/img]\nFor the rest of the Traitor's nitty-gritty details, check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/408900/discussions/2/5015307809834558235/]the full patch notes[/url], or explore and experiment in-game!\n\n[h3]A New Pair of Gumshoes[/h3]\n\nThe Investigator Profession has received a substantial buff. Along with some functional changes to the way the Pocket Detective works (you'll see when you use it!) the Traitor's ship can now be scanned to rank up to Investigator Level 2. Once Investigator Level 2, the Investigator can see and track breadcrumbs left behind by the Traitor when they use their B.R.I.C.K. device.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/84882fc487196a90b10f81ef73021fdc7a37a457.gif[/img]\n\nYou'll be hot on the trail in no time!\n\nThere's also a few more scannable objects in the environment, but all we'll say is; lore-hunters will want to equip a Pocket Detective. Trust us on that one.\n\n... Oh, and Investigators start with Magnums, like any good P.I. should.\n\n[h3]Evolution Complete[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/0404dc275eeebff4398a102b3d81cd54546affca.gif[/img]\nIn order to reduce the frequency of early-game aggression, the Monster is now locked out from certain perks and abilities until they evolve 3 times through the course of the beginning of the round. This means the Monster can not transform (without a syringe) until reaching the first evolution stage.\n\nA couple important rules:\n[list]\n[*] If the Monster evolves whenever possible, they should be fully evolved by the First Tribunal. (Not long!)\n[*] Evolution is noisey and takes about 5 seconds, therefore it should generally be done in a safe, hidden location whenever possible.\n[/list]\nAll of this may sound somewhat complicated, but in practice, it is fairly straightforward and the Evolution Track on the HUD should make it fairly clear what is initially locked. The end result should simply be that Monster can no longer eliminate half the lobby in the first 2 or 3 minutes of the round. Along with the Traitor and other balance tweaks, we feel that everyone will live longer on average, therefore spending less time sad and dead. This is something we're continuing to focus on going forward.\n\nAs the Spokesman would say, go get 'em, Tiger.\n\n[h3]Time To Perk Up[/h3]\n\nWe've gotten feedback that it's a bit difficult to rank up in order to experience the full range of Perk gameplay Spacemen has to offer, so we've moved all Perk unlocks into sequential order -- or something close to it. In short, every single Rank, you will receive at least 1 new Perk, until you've unlocked them all. This should greatly benefit smaller friend groups (people who don't play on the public servers) and everyone else climbing through the ranks.\n\n[h3]Monsters with Professions: A Lil' Rebalancing[/h3]\n\nWe realized that Monster's were running [i]*checks notes[/i] just the Doctor Profession because it's pretty dang good. We made some Monster-only changes to all the other Professions to bring them up to a better meta-viability level (that's a real thing we totally care about.)\n\n[list]\n[*] Recruit: As Monster, you now gain Evolution Points slightly faster than normal.\n[*] Janitor: As Monster, airlocks will no longer trigger in Monster Form as well.\n[*] Soldier: As Monster, can not be shoved in Monster Form. Like other non-shoveable states, this also blocks damage from Brawny shoves. A specific Monster roar now triggers when a shove fails due to Soldier perk blocking the shove.\n[*] Cultist: As Monster, you receive no audio or visual debuffs from Space Milk. This means you can still use voice and text chat after Space Milking, and no particles will appear over your head.\n[*] Warden: As Monster, in Monster Form, your shove is 50% more powerful and causes victims to turn AWAY from you instead of towards you as a normal shove would.\n[*] Investigator: As Monster, can see Health Bars over Spacemen heads. (This trait was removed from Membrane.)\n[*] Membrane Perk: No longer shows Health Bars over Spacemen heads.\n[/list]\n[h3]Railgun Nerf[/h3]\n\nYeah. You knew it was coming. We love the high-octane all-blood no-mercy hip-fire insta-kill clips -- they're a real hoot -- but it turns out it's not very fun for your victims. The Railgun is no longer accurate when hipfired. You will need to typically aim through the scope, you know, like a sniper rifle. Because it's a sniper rifle.\n\n[h3]Weapon Speed[/h3]\n\nAs part of our efforts to slow down the aggression just a bit, we're pulling on the reigns [i]just a smidge.[/i] We've reduced the Handgun and Auto-Shotty firerates, a wee little bit.\n\n[h3]Spreading Out The Power[/h3]\n\nThe total number of Generators has been reduced, and almost all of the Generators are further apart, primarily to stop solo or roaming bands of Spacemen from restoring power. The intent of Generators has always been to slow down and spread out the Spacemen, and this practice was defeating that. Problem solved (probably.)\n\n[h3]Space Bar Rework[/h3]\nEveryone's favorite cinema pub in SPAAAAAAAACE has been overhauled to improve Monster viability primarily by improving routing, giving more ambush locations, and reducing total oxygenation in the central play spaces. We have also taken this time to improve the overall visual quality of the map. \n\nLet's just let the pictures do the talking.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/2dddfbf55d46bcf475fb12fad89828cdb39dad71.png[/img]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/4d9e8532fa42bf94b06e8294971b99bfdd1f23b3.png[/img]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/9dc5f369849e6cb4f220267ed60de9b1a7071175.png[/img]\n\nAlso, we made Tidal Lock safer. Woops.\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/885688d8c81d535f2334ecfa4c7a2112dbe4e452.png[/img]\n\n[h3]Cretinous Corporate Crap[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/86dd87337dadf7c7f95dc1ea723d40ff3378c01a.png[/img]\nThe Company has distributed Lil' Jubby figurines to all facilities, the perfect pal for any bedside table, lounge decoration, or office workspace. Please treat them with the reverence and respect they deserve.\n\n[h3]Doctor's Orders[/h3]\n\nHealth Syringe Dispensers have been placed in one spot in every map. Doctors can use this to buy a Health Syringe with their Employee Points. A sign of things to come? Ah, who knows. Maybe after we'd had some coffee we could answer tha--\n\n[h3]Makin' Moves[/h3]\n\nSeveral improvements have been made to animations. Here's a list of fun new actions to see in this update:\n[list]\n[*] Welding now takes time to complete and has a new animation\n[*] All animations that zoom the camera out now allow free mouse rotation\n[*] Several of new animations when picking up (or failing to pick up) items\n[*] Keycard swipe animations (for lock and unlock)\n[*] New first-person deploy animation when placing turrets or throwing down traps or medkits\n[*] New first-person animations when pulling out weapons\n[*] New zombification animation for Corpse Lord zombies\n[*] Third-person overheat animations so you can see when another player has an overheated weapon\n[/list]\n[h3]That Bellicose Blue[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/94a4584a3267e9d7c4b4c8192fea681f03a8c97e.png[/img]\nSecurity Bots now have a bit more humanity to them. That is to say, they can also shove you now. You know, just like your other fellow humans. Or whatever Spacemen are. \n\nAlso, The Company has repainted the robots, but you probably already [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/408900/view/2954910249012510265]read about that,[/url] because you like that [i]deep space lore[/i] that's been strewn all over 1.5.\n\n[h3]HUD Clutter and Proximity Text Chat[/h3]\n\nIn an effort to reduce some of the HUD clutter, now only the closest 5 sealed Research Samples will show on your HUD. Additionally, error and warning messages will no longer be spammable, which should drastically reduce text visible at any given time.\n\nThis is all quite convenient, because local proximity text chat will now also show on your HUD -- if you're in range of it when it's spoken. The profanity filter has also been improved, blocking more specific words, and no longer accidentally blocking parts of words that are perfectly safe and wholesome.\n\n[h3]Hearanoia[/h3]\n\nWe've updated [i]a lot[/i] of sounds, so in general the soundscape should feel a bit less cluttered, and several objects should sound unique, more meaningful, and less overpowering as a whole. Along with that, we've added unique pain and death sounds for Feminine and Robotic voice packs. In space, it turns out you can actually hear a lot of screaming.\n\n[h3]Map List for Dedicated Servers[/h3]\n\nNot only does this update introduce proper Map Lists for dedicated servers, we've also added the ability to disable map voting (force an automatic map rotation) and the ability to hide moderators in lobby if you'd like to keep your moderators a bit more [i]undercover.[/i]\n\nWe've updated the EXAMPLE_Game.ini that ships with the server files, and you can learn all about how to set up and manage a dedicated server (including these new features) in our [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2128687084]Official Dedicated Server Guide.[/url]\n\n[i]Note: Please be aware that the player-facing map name may differ from the map filename! Read the guide carefully before telling us your map list is incorrect![/i]\n\n[h3]Message of the Day for Dedicated Servers[/h3]\n\nDue to popular demand...\n\nYou can now set up an motd.txt (next to your BanList.txt, AdminList.txt, and ModList.txt) in order to display a Message of the Day on your dedicated server. It's limited to 1000 characters and is seen (briefly) upon spawning, and (as long as the player wants) in the Escape menu during gameplay.\n\n[h3]Have Your Space-Cake and Wear It Too[/h3]\nIn celebration of our 1-year anniversary (which zoomed by during development of 1.5) we have a new Cake helmet available to anyone who owns/plays the game prior to August 31st, 2021. Make sure you grab this sweet helmet and celebrate Spacemen's epic journey from obscurity to slightly-less-Among-Us-adjacent obscurity. (Hey, if we don't laugh, we cry.)\n\n[h3]New Cosmetics, New Achievements[/h3]\n\nWe have several new achievements, which reward several new sprays and nameplates.\n[list]\n[*] New Achievement: For The Homeworld: Win a game as an agent of BRIGADE. Must be alive and in a game with at least 4 players. (Grab this one to secure the BRIGADE Cell helmet!)\n[*] New Achievement: For The Greater Good: Win a game as an agent of BRIGADE, even though you died. Must be dead and in a game with at least 4 players.\n[*] New Achievement: Sower of Chaos: As an agent of BRIGADE, hack 20 different objects in a single match.\n[*] New Achievement: Missing The Point: Drink Space Milk as an agent of BRIGADE.\n[*] New Achievement: Hot On The Trail: As an Investigator, scan the Traitor's ship in order to locate additional clues.\n[*] 2 New Hidden Achievements (The Most Convincing Con and Lunar Eclipse)\n[/list]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/a5ccae6e81241453e4e78019719b714293790f5b.png[/img]\nYou can also pick up the new [url=https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/408900/detail/7012/]Necronaut Bundle[/url], which comes with a nameplate, Cosmonaut Helmet, Cosmonaut Suit, Cosmos Visor, and the dreaded, tentacle-laden Necronaut Monster Skin!\n\nThere are also a few new visors to pick up, such as the Purple Lava Lamp visor, Iridescent visor bundle, and Cheese visor!\n\n[h3]Cosmetics Sale[/h3]\n\nAs a small bonus, all cosmetics prior to this update are 50% off during the Realms Deep event! [url=https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/408900/]Snag some cheap bling while you can![/url]\n\n[h3]The Future[/h3]\n\nA little note from Geoff \"Zag\" Keene, creator of Unfortunate Spacemen.\n\n[i]As many of you know, Unfortunate Spacemen has been a project of passion -- and a little bit more than that -- for myself, our Art Lead Connor, our 2D-shader-whatever-she-does Jenny, and all of the New Blood team (especially the QA team!) for many years, sometimes full-time, sometimes alongside other day jobs. Now more than 1 year out from our 1.0 release, we look fondly back on our craziest updates like Perkageddon, The Tribunal update, and Kema's release -- and now we look forward to the future.\n\nAs you might've seen on our [url=https://trello.com/b/1m7s5FkO/unfortunate-spacemen-starmap]Development Starmap[/url], we've got a couple big updates in store featuring the return of a reworked Duress, an overhaul to tasks (adding a bunch more!) and updating the tutorials for all the new changes that have piled in over the last year. We hope you enjoy the new Traitor role, and be sure to drop in and say hi on [url=http://discord.gg/NewBlood]our discord server![/url]\n\nThank you for being part of this adventure, and we'll see you in space![/i]\n\n[b]As with all updates, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/408900/discussions/2/5015307809834558235/]the Full Patch Notes[/url] will reveal the tiny details for those that like to go over every patch with a fine-toothed comb. Also, they're pretty funny sometimes.[/b]\n\nUntil next transmission, Operator.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/408900/Unfortunate_Spacemen/",

Well, most of you are humans. \n\nHumans and everyone else, listen up![/h3][/i]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/a10f8ca57d130d56f51862b8f13e4795500c9838.png[/img]\n\nUpdate 1.4 \"Kema\" has arrived! This update brings an entirely new map, two major map reworks, loads of balance changes, other bug fixes, quality of life, and some VOIP improvements!\n\n[h3]NEW SHAPESHIFTER MAP: KEMA[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/ff77a36a19cc4e7f27e75d2de68cc434c9b2d0f9.png[/img]\nOld to few, but new to most, introducing the latest map; [b]Kema![/b] This icy mining outpost has been rumored to be cursed, going through multiple overhauls and rennovations to shed this image. Perhaps this time [b]The Company[/b] got it right? Only one way to find out! This medium-sized map is now available to everyone, and easily supports all player counts. [i]Do watch out for the drill.[/i]\n\n[h3]INDIVIDUAL VOIP SLIDERS PER PLAYER[/h3]\nA large part of this update was sorting out why VOIP issues persist, and where. The Company is dedicated to providing a clean and efficient communicaiton system for all personnel, so your last words are always crystal clear.\n\nWe identified one major issue with VOIP was that some Spacemen were far too quiet, and others were simply far too loud, creating an environment where hearing everyone was out of reach at times. Along with boosting VOIP volume across the board, our VOIP improvements in this update are adding individual VOIP sliders for every single person.\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/354d68a76f69ca2843c910ebad732d3ccfd481d0.png[/img]\nSimply access the player in the Lobby, F1 player list, or end-round screens, and adjust their volume to your heart's content. This should resolve most cases where one particularly quiet player, and one particularly loud player, are no longer competing for your eartention.\n\n[h3]IMPROVED HITBOXES[/h3]\n\nWe did a pass on hitboxes, meaning you will only take bullets in location where you would be reasonably expected to take bullets. This should also diminish cases where bullets might pass through targets when they shouldn't. [b]We're basically an eSport now.[/b]\n\n[h3]GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE / HUD IMPROVEMENTS[/h3]\n\nA bunch of small tweaks and new additions to sounds and animations on the HUD have been done to improve readability in certain situations, such as when a parasite decides to take its relationship with your face a bit further, or when a Monster chomps your feet. Or when a Spaceman syringes you as you hide amongst them.\n\n[h3]NEW DAMAGE SOUNDS[/h3]\n\nAs you know, last patch we added some new damage sounds for things like taking damage from fire. Well, in this update, we've made them better, and added even more! Now when you're standing in a puddle of acid, or getting hit by grenade shrapnel, or losing a fight with the void of space, you'll hear it better than ever.\n\n[h3]HATCHERY TWEAKS[/h3]\n\nHatcheries planted by a Monster with the Crumerian Host perk will no longer reset all of their health when they evolve to the next level of Hatchery. This means they will instead transfer the current percentage of their health when leveling up, so if you got a Hatchery to 50%, it will now be at 50% health with its new health values.\n\nAs an addendum, Drones can now be seen through walls with the Thermal Vision Enhancer. [b]Spicy.[/b]  \n\n[h3]ACID BEAST / ACID BOMB[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/68897934d2934c428a1839ccbdbb2a533137b2d5.gif[/img]\nAs part of our on-going effort to balance perks, improve anti-fun mechanics (mostly revolving around unavoidable instant death), and give each Monster Mutation perk its own identity, Acid Beast is moving further into an \"area-denial\" role. Acid Bombs no longer detonate with the force of a thousand suns, but instead burst into a growing acid puddle. To help with this, all Acid Puddles now deal much higher damage and are strictly on The Company's \"Do Not Tread\" list.\n\nBe not afraid, however! All those years of Janitor School have paid off. The Fire Extinguisher can now extinguish Acid Puddles.\n\n[h3]ZOMBIES, ZOMBIES, AND ZOMBIES, OH MY[/h3]\n\nThe Monster Mutation perk \"Corpse Lord\" has received some major rebalancing in this update. Zombies have received a health nerf, and large improvements to their ability to find targets on some of the more wonky maps, such as those with teleporters or (JUB FORBID) knee-high coffee tables. \n\nThis perk has also lost the ability to eat bodies without a trace as we felt it was just a bit TOO STRONG and left little for the Spacemen to grow paranoid about. We feel this perk is now in a much better place, and more in line with the rest of the perks in its class. We'll be monitoring changes like this very closely.\n\n[h3]TRIBUNAL TWEAKS[/h3]\n\nSome penalties have been reduced on The Tribunal. Not visiting the Tribunal will result in a smaller loss of points than before, and the Monster no longer loses points for skipping The Tribunal. This was done to give the Monster more tactical options during a round.\n\n[h3]RESCUE SHUTTLE CHANGE[/h3]\n\nTo improve readability of which stage of Shuttle Rescue the round is currently in, the Rescue Shuttle no longer touches down until the doors are ready to open. Now, the Rescue Shuttle will hover for 30 seconds before touching down and opening the doors, instead of idling on the Landing Pad for that duration. Don't get squished!\n\n[h3]AIRLOCK COOLDOWN[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/f55b856eef58c7e33028d1e0e60a5437c4b70130.gif[/img]\nAirlocks now show their current cooldown on the center of the glass. This will give personnel a better read on when an airlock is ready to be activated again. ... Speaking of airlocks, let's talk about Tidal Lock.\n\n[h3]A CHANGE IN THE TIDES[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/c7d86d419db2f5aafcda5d27d6248d3da40b109b.gif[/img]\nTidal Lock is the first of two maps that have gotten a rework in this update. The bottom floor of Tidal Lock -- the one with the shops and all that -- is completely gone. Tidal Lock is now two floors, and many of the navigation pathways have been improved, as well as readability of the scenery, the appearance of the surrounding skybox and atmosphere of the planet, and many other tweaks to improve flow. Enjoy a new, safer experience, where death is no longer around every corner... Just, you know, still a lot of them. Be careful out there!\n\n[h3]THE EXPERIMENT - EXPANDED![/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/5507cb60ddb7bdb5c74f75c45b2606be4b3e1699.jpg[/img]\nThe cube has opened. The number holes have shifted place. The Undercheese has arrived. What does any of this mean? That's what The Company is trying to figure out, and with the new and improved Experiment, you can help them solve it. Monsters should find this territory far more welcoming with an expanded playspace and many new paths and avenues for terrorizing the mice within this maze. \n\nEnjoy this new and improved rework of [i]The Experiment.[/i]\n\n[h3]DURESS IN DURESS[/h3]\n\nAs this update reworks two maps and adds a new one, we thought this was a good time to address the stress around Duress. We love Duress. We want it to be a strong, happy map, that runs well on everyone's gaming rigs. Therefore, Duress has been removed from the game AND WILL RETURN SOON with a full rework targeting navigation of the map, performance concerns, Tram issues, and, well, just about everything else.\n\nDuress, we look forward to your re-appearance in the future and we promise your BUMPIN' SOUNDTRACK will stay intact.\n\n[h3]SPACE HUNK[/h3]\n\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/a95509bc36b418e29ef25b378682603852eeda8a.png[/img]\nIt's here.

Anyone who owns [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/246900/Viscera_Cleanup_Detail/]Viscera Cleanup Detail on Steam[/url] will receive a suit and helmet that screams \"I just work here.\"\n\n[h3]NEW VICTORY POSES[/h3]\n[img]{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/23984338/71492c326bda0e304bfc370f40c63ae5062f748e.gif[/img]\nTo celebrate the casual cooperation of Viscera Cleanup Detail, a new victory pose, Mop 'Em Up! is now available on the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/408900/]item store.[/url] But that's not all! Feeling like a party animal? Grab the Space Monkey victory pose and show everyone else how it's done.\n\n[h3]NEW ACHIEVEMENTS[/h3]\n\nThere are four new achievements to obtain, and loads of new sprays tied to these new achievements, as well as a bunch of existing achievements. Big thanks to everyone who submitted Sprays, and please don't hesitate to continue submitting them on our Discord.\n\n[h3]LOADS OF BUG FIXES[/h3]\n\nWe fixed a bunch of little things all over the place, as we always do, including a few pretty big ones that have been plaguing the community.\n\nAs always, you can read the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/408900/discussions/2/5002914669819460580/]FULL PATCH NOTES[/url] for more details and all other changes, and check out the [url=https://trello.com/b/1m7s5FkO/unfortunate-spacemen-starmap]Development Starmap[/url] for our plans towards 1.5 and beyond!\n\nThat's all for now!

Due to an apparent lack of forward planning, the facility never attained full operational status. \n\n[b]>>[/b] The Kema Extraction Facility offers a lucrative income stream for The Company, but they are known to have agendas in the sector beyond mere mining and resource acquisition. Their continued efforts on Kema point to the planet’s strategic importance to The Company, notably their CEO. Given his nature and propensities, determining his intentions and deeper goals is challenging, but he appears to harbor a specific interest in the location. \n\n[b]>>[/b] Kema was a site of operations for Jericho Class meta-entities in several antecedent periods. AMP assessments indicate this fact has a high relevance to The Company’s current activities, with a significant likelihood that their apparent ‘carelessness’ is, in fact, a tactic intended to disguise their true capabilities and ambitions in this arena.\n\n[b]>>[/b] It is clear that BRIGADE must oppose The Company’s operations on Kema, while seeking further data on their long-term aims for the planet. Two potential courses of action suggest themselves.\n\n[b]>>[/b] The Company has already suffered moderate losses on Kema. A training facility was recently infiltrated by a so-called ‘Shapeshifter’, which proceeded to render operation of the outpost unfeasible (see archives re: Kema, Bone World IV). The organism in question was never apprehended, and the Company has predictably failed to address this issue. This remains a source of operational uncertainty for the group – AMP assessments put the Kema Extraction Facility at +78% risk of a similar event. This scenario requires no further action on our part, and profoundly impedes The Company’s ability to operate effectively. However, it will not advance BRIGADE’s knowledge of The Company’s strategic goals in the region.\n\n[b]>>[/b] The importance of Kema may require activation of long-standing, embedded intelligence assets within The Company. These personnel can leverage the disruption caused by the Shapeshifter in order to advance BRIGADE goals, including intelligence gathering and impairment. This proposal will need to be approved at Echelon 3 or higher. Tactical priorities suggest expediting this process.\n\n[b]>> [/b]Reading the preceding memorandum constitutes acceptance of confidentiality as stipulated in Article 6.5.2 of BRIGADE Internal Operations Code.",
